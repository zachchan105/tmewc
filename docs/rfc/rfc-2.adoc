= RFC 2: tMEWC Group Selection and Key Generation

:icons: font

toc::[]

== Overview

The key generation uses the protocol from `tss-lib`.

We select members from the sortition pool,
and they perform one or more attempts to complete the key generation.

Inactive members are removed from the DKG participants
and the resulting wallet if the DKG is successful.

If there is misbehaviour,
the accusations will be resolved by governance
as the protocol in `tss-lib` is not attributable.

=== Parameter selection

For tmewc2 wallets,
we need to choose the group size _N_
(how many members we select from the sortition pool)
and the threshold _T_
(how many members must cooperate to generate a threshold ECDSA signature).

In addition, we need to choose the critical size _C_
which is number of members required for a successful key generation.
Some of the selected _N_ members may not be available for the key generation.
To reduce sortition costs,
we let some of the original _N_ be inactive
as long as at least _C_ participants can be assembled to complete the DKG.
After successful DKG completion,
the created wallet will have a number of members
that is between _C_ and _N_ (inclusive).
The inactive members that did not participate in the successful DKG
are removed from the wallet's members and are ineligible for rewards.

If we cannot complete DKG successfully
with at least _C_ participants
within the allowed time,
the failed wallet will not be used by TMEWC.

==== Group size and threshold

Assuming we create groups every 24h and the lifespan of TMEWC is 100 years,
we would perform 36,500 sortitions in total.
If an adversary has a 1:1,000,000 probability of controlling any given group,
they'd have a roughly 3.6% probability of controlling one group at some point.

Assuming 51/100 (N = 100, T = 51) would make an acceptably secure wallet,
we can compare it to other parameter choices of similar security.

It can be generally observed,
that a slight increase in the T:N ratio
compensates for a fairly large reduction in N (and T).
A lower _N_ significantly reduces sortition costs.
The downside of this is that the group has fewer redundant members
which requires greater reliability from each individual node.
In addition,
a malicious actor with more than _N - T_ members
is guaranteed to be able to DoS the group.
In practice this is less significant
as non-attributable threshold ECDSA protocols are vulnerable to DoS
by an adversary controlling a significantly smaller number of members.

From modeling we get the following security levels for different parameters
against adversaries of various power:

[%header,cols=7]
|===
|T/N |Bits against 0.15 |0.2 |0.25 |0.3 |0.35 |0.4

|76/150 |>54 |>54 |36.74 |23.64 |14.23 |7.66

|51/100 |>54 |38.00 |25.74 |16.91 |10.49 |5.94

|41/80 |>54 |31.19 |21.36 |14.21 |8.97 |5.23

|44/80 |>54 |37.90 |26.78 |18.56 |12.38 |7.78

|36/70 |40.30 | 27.82 |19.16 |12.85 |8.21 |4.87

|40/70 |>54 |37.01 |26.66 |18.93 |13.03 |8.54

|26/50 |29.95 |21.07 |14.75 |10.11 |6.66 |4.14

|32/50 |>54 |36.07 |27.29 |20.53 |15.20 |10.95
|===

The probability of an adversary controlling the given fraction of operators
controlling at least _T_ members of _N_ randomly selected operators
equals `1 / 2^bits`.

The given numbers are calculated using a hypergeometric distribution
out of 10,000 operators;
using a binomial distribution instead has insignificant effect.

==== Critical size

We don't expect all _N_ members to be available for key generation.
However, to ensure sufficient availability
we require at least _C_ members to complete key generation.

A _C_ closer to _N_ prevents the creation of low-quality wallets
which would be at risk of low availability
at the cost of increasing the risk of key generation failing to complete.
A lower _C_ increases the odds of successfully creating a wallet.

In any case,
_C_ should be sufficiently above _T_
that created wallets are adequately reliable in use
and the risk of losing a wallet in its entirety
by the number of active operators falling below _T_
is minimised.

=== Group selection

When at least a _minimum sortition interval_ (_I~min~_, e.g. 12h)
has passed since the last group selection for a new wallet,
anyone can submit (and pay for) a transaction creating a new wallet.
This transaction uses the sortition pool to select N members
and creates a new wallet with the selected members,
instructing them to begin key generation.
The selected members may contain duplicate operators.
The new wallet is added to the pending wallets.

The submitter of this sortition transaction is rewarded.

If the minimum sortition interval has not passed,
transactions attempting to create a new wallet are rejected.

==== Sortition transaction reimbursement

When TMEWC is collected in deposit fees,
a certain fraction (e.g. 10%) of the fee is placed in the sortition fee pool.

The transaction to perform a new sortition can be submitted by anyone.
The submitter of the transaction is reimbursed from the sortition fee pool.

The amount reimbursed depends
on whether the _nominal sortition interval_ (_I~nom~_, e.g. 24h)
has passed since the last sortition.
If at least the nominal interval has elapsed since the most recent sortition,
the full contents of the sortition fee pool are released to the submitter.
If less than the nominal interval has elapsed,
the amount released to the submitter is reduced,
and the remainder is released as general rewards
to other participants in the TMEWC system.

This reduction is calculated
based on the amount of time since the last sortition,
compared to the minimum and nominal intervals:
_fraction = time - I~min~ / I~nom~ - I~min~_.
For example, if _I~min~_ = 12h, _I~nom~_ = 24h,
and 21h has elapsed since the last sortition,
we calculate the fraction of passed time as
`21 - 12 / 24 - 12 = 9 / 12 = 0.75`.

This reduction can be linear
(the fraction released equals the fraction of time that has passed),
quadratic/cubic
(the fraction released equals the square/cube of the time fraction)
or exponential
(for every hour before 24h has passed, the released fraction is halved).

This lets the market decide when enough reward has accumulated
to cover the gas fees of a new sortition transaction
without the need for methods such as price oracles.
It also balances the creation rate of new wallets with the deposit rate;
when large amounts of MEWC are deposited,
new wallets will be created more frequently.

By limiting the reward before 24h has elapsed,
excessive creation of new wallets is disincentivised.
This aims to give each wallet a reasonable opportunity to collect deposits
before it is replaced by a new one,
and limit the number of wallets active at the same time.

=== Key generation

Because every participant needs to be present and active
for the full duration of key generation,
failures are likely to happen.
To avoid expensive new sortition,
a two-phase retry protocol is specified to deal with failures.

In this RFC, the word "majority" means at least _T_ out of _N_ operators,
if _T_ is greater than _N/2+1_.

==== Two-phase retry protocol

The full key generation protocol consists of individual _attempts_.
In each attempt,
the specified participants signal their readiness,
establish encryption keys between each other,
and then try to perform DKG with the protocol from `tss-lib`.

If the attempt fails due to one or more participants being inactive,
the inactive participants are removed from the DKG participants
and another attempt is made.

If the number of DKG participants falls below the critical size _C_,
no further attempt is made by the remaining participants.
Instead, the group will clear the list of inactive participants
and wait 12h before making another attempt with the entire group.
This repeats until 7 days have elapsed
since the timestamp of the sortition transaction.
If this ultimate timeout is reached without successful key generation,
the group dissolves and makes no further attempts.

The intent of the two-phase retry protocol is
to give node maintainers time to be alerted of and fix any problems
that may have caused a large number of participants to drop out.

==== Communication between participants

Participants communicate using a broadcast channel.
One-to-one messages are delivered by broadcasting them in encrypted form,
using the key specific to the pair of participants.

When operator Alice starts key generation,
she establishes encryption keys with all other participants.
When Alice sends a message that is intended for everyone,
it is broadcast in plaintext to the entire group.
When Alice sends a message intended only for Bob,
she encrypts it using the key she has established with Bob,
and broadcasts the ciphertext message.
When Bob expects to receive an encrypted message from Alice,
he takes Alice's broadcast message
containing her encrypted payloads to all other participants,
and decrypts the payload addressed to him
using the key he has established with Alice.

Both plaintext and ciphertext messages are authenticated by the sender.

==== Removing inactive operators

If Alice fails to receive the expected message from Bob
within the specified timeout for the phase,
she broadcasts this information to the rest of the group.
If the majority of participants agree that Bob failed to send the message,
Bob is added to the list of inactive members.

If one or more operators are deemed to be inactive
in the readiness signaling and key exchange phases,
before the DKG proper begins,
they are removed from the DKG participants and the attempt continues.
If an operator becomes inactive during DKG,
the remaining participants start another key generation attempt
with all inactive participants removed.

If the majority does not agree that Bob failed to send the message,
Bob will not be considered inactive.
The current attempt will continue if no operators were deemed inactive.

==== Dealing with misbehaviour

The protocol in `tss-lib` is not attributable.
When a participant is unable to proceed
because they have received an invalid message from another participant,
they will broadcast a special message declaring a _disqualification abort_
and naming one or more participants who sent invalid messages.

When a _disqualification abort message_ is broadcast by any member,
group selection is aborted and no further attempts are made by the group.
Instead, the group signs and submits an on-chain transaction
announcing that key generation was aborted due to disqualification,
and identifying the participants in the aborted attempt,
the members who declared a disqualification abort
and the members who were accused of sending invalid messages.
All participants will also store their logs of the aborted attempt
to facilitate later investigation.
These logs must contain all messages sent and received by the participant,
private keys the participant had established with all other participants,
and all secret values the participant generated for the key generation attempt.

Governance will then resolve the matter by investigating the stored logs
and taking any action deemed appropriate as permitted by the contract.
Governance may penalise any operators
named in a disqualification abort transaction
as either the accusing or accused parties.

The `tss-lib` protocol is intended to be eventually replaced
with a fully attributable key generation protocol.
When the key generation protocol is replaced,
the powers of governance to adjudicate misbehaviour off-chain
and penalise operators deemed to have misbehaved
are to be removed in favour of a fully objective resolution method.

==== Successful key generation

When an attempt at key generation finishes successfully,
a transaction announcing this result is submitted on-chain.
The transaction contains the public key from the successful DKG attempt,
the list of participants in that successful attempt,
and signatures from a majority of participants.

The on-chain contract verifies
that all listed participants are among the originally selected members,
and that all provided signatures are valid signatures from different members.
If the submission passes these checks,
the newly created wallet is removed from the pending wallets
and appended to the list of active wallets,
its state is set to _Active_,
and its activation time is recorded.

If some participants were inactive in the key generation,
it might be desirable to remove them from the sortition pool.

==== Key generation timeout

If the on-chain contract does not receive a valid DKG result submission
within 7 days of the sortition timestamp,
the wallet is deemed to have timed out.
Any submission after 7 days is rejected,
and the wallet is removed from the list of pending wallets.
If no late submission is made,
the wallet should eventually be removed from the list of pending wallets
by a maintenance procedure not specified in this RFC.
