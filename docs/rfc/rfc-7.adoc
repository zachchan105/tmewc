== Background

Before generating tECDSA signature, the off-chain client software needs to agree
in the signing group on the message being signed. In tMEWC, the information
needed to evaluate the signed message comes from multiple sources that might not
be ideally synced with each other. Moreover, it is not possible to establish a
precise point in time based on which the information should be retrieved.

=== Current Functionality

In tMEWC v1, the message to be signed is calculated on-chain

and link:https://github.com/keep-network/tmewc/blob/d18ef9aec7656f0ec7d317ece3e3d5c7aca92cda/solidity/contracts/deposit/DepositRedemption.sol#L291-L316[when increasing the redemption fee].
Every single deposit is under a separate P2WPKH address and is confirmed with
SPV proof. This, plus the fact the redemption can be done only one time for the
given deposit makes it possible to generate the message to be signed on-chain
and does not require additional coordination between signing group members. The
signing group members do not have to worry about confirming the P2WPKH deposit
transaction on Meowcoin because it is covered by the SPV on-chain proof submitted
to Ethereum by the depositor.

This approach is easy to integrate with off-chain client software but is way
more expensive on-chain compared to the approach taken by tMEWC.

In tMEWC, 51-of-100 tECDSA-backed wallets accept multiple deposits. Depositors
send MEWC to the most-recently-created-wallet using P2SH transaction and reveal
their deposit transaction to Ethereum chain. The off-chain client software must
listen for these sorts of events and periodically check the Meowcoin network to
ensure P2SH deposits are sufficiently confirmed. If everything checks out, the
off-chain client software should coordinate to produce signatures and perform
a sweeping Meowcoin transaction that is confirmed on Ethereum with SPV proof and
updates depositors' balances in the Bridge.

This approach is more cost-effective: it allows to split of the cost of SPV
proof between multiple depositors and does not require expensive signing group
key generation for every single deposit. Yet, it requires the off-chain client
software to coordinate - before producing signatures - to decide which deposits
should be swept and with what Meowcoin network fee.

== Proposal

This document aims at describing a protocol for reaching an agreement about the
Meowcoin sweep transaction between the signing group members.

=== Goal

The protocol should tolerate small differences in the state of the world, as
seen by individual signing group members. It should be compatible with a light
relay, and support signing retries. All transactions must be sufficiently
confirmed and the sweep transaction must adhere to the recent Meowcoin network
fees.

==== Sufficiently confirmed transactions

The P2SH transactions on Meowcoin must be sufficiently confirmed (at least 6
confirmations) before they are eligible for sweeping. The deposit reveal
transactions on Ethereum must be sufficiently confirmed (at least 20
confirmations) before they are eligible for sweeping.

==== No order guaranteed

There is no guarantee which transaction gets a sufficient number of
confirmations first: Meowcoin P2SH deposit transaction or Ethereum deposit reveal
transactions. The order in which P2SH deposit transactions gets confirmed on
Meowcoin does not need to correspond to the order in which deposit reveal
transaction gets confirmed on Ethereum. There is also no guarantee that the
Ethereum reveal transaction points to an existing Meowcoin P2SH transaction.

==== State differences

Every tMEWC client software instance is connected to different Ethereum and
Meowcoin clients. Ethereum clients in the network will have a slightly different
synchronization state at any given point in time. Meowcoin clients in the network
will also have a slightly different synchronization state. Since the light relay
is not submitting all Meowcoin headers to Ethereum, there is no way to reference
from Ethereum to a fixed point in time on Meowcoin. We must accept the fact that
all tMEWC client software will have a slightly different view of the world at
any point in time.

==== Adhere to network conditions

The Meowcoin sweep transaction must have a fee that allows it to be mined in a
reasonable time. If the Meowcoin network conditions change, there must be a
mechanism to increase the fee and replace transactions. The wallet must finish
the current operation before attempting another one.

==== Retries

The tECDSA protocol used for signing must be able to retry in case some signing
group members are offline or corrupted.

=== Implementation

==== Coordinator

We introduce a rotating role of Coordinator responsible for proposing a sweep
Meowcoin transaction. The role of Coordinator rotates every 8 hours across all
operators in the group. For example, if the group consist of the following
members: `[0xA, 0xB, 0xC, 0xC, 0xB, 0xD`] the rotation rounds are: `0xA, 0xB,
0xC, 0xD`. The rotation schedule begins at UNIX epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January
1970).

==== Sweeping schedule

Sweep can only be proposed by the current Coordinator.

The Coordinator may propose a sweep at any time if either `sweep_period` seconds
passed since the proof of the last sweep was accepted by the Bridge or if at least
`sweep_max_deposits` deposits wait in the queue for sweeping.
In other words, we always attempt to sweep every `sweep_period` seconds, and can
sweep early if we have enough deposits waiting - at least `sweep_max_deposits`.
Two aspects put a cap on how many deposits can be swept at once: Ethereum block
gas limits and the time it takes to sign a sweep transaction input. Given that
in normal circumstances, the active wallet is not redeeming or moving funds, the
active wallet can focus on sweeping and optimize its work schedule for this
operation, depending on the current situation in the Bridge. 

The Coordinator must not propose a sweep if there is currently a pending signing
operation being executed by the wallet or if the last signed transaction from
the wallet has not been proven to the Bridge yet.

The Coordinator may slightly delay broadcasting the proposition to give all
clients in the group a chance to properly recognize a Coordinator rotation.

If we sweep early because a lot of deposits have been revealed, then we don't
"push back" our scheduled `sweep_period` sweep. Rather, that sweep continues
as planned.

*Example*: We have a `sweep_period = 8 hours` and `sweep_max_deposits = 15`. At
08:00 UTC, a sweep just occurred, and the next is scheduled for 16:00 UTC.
At 10:00 UTC, 15 deposits get revealed which triggers an early sweep due to
`sweep_max_deposits`. Rather than pushing back the next scheduled sweep to
18:00 UTC, it remains at 16:00 UTC.

==== Sweep transaction

The Coordinator chooses sufficiently confirmed deposits for the sweep. To avoid
synchronization problems with deposits on the brink of being sufficiently
confirmed, the Coordinator may choose deposits with more than 6 confirmations
on Meowcoin and 20 confirmations on Ethereum. To avoid problems with proving
large transactions and too many signatures to be executed, the Coordinator
should not pick more than 15 deposits. The Coordinator chooses the Meowcoin
transaction fee reflecting the current situation in the Meowcoin network and the
maximum possible fee accepted by the Bridge. To leave enough time for retries,
deposits for which Meowcoin transactions unlock for a refund earlier than two
weeks from now are skipped (`sweeping_refund_safety_time`).

The Coordinator must not propose a sweep if there is currently a pending signing
operation being executed by the wallet or if the last transaction from the
wallet does not have 6 Meowcoin confirmations yet.

The Coordinator proposes a sweep over the wallet's broadcast channel.

All signing group members must confirm that all deposits in the proposed sweep
are sufficiently confirmed, that the maximum number of deposits is not exceeded,
that the proposed fee reflects the current situation in the Meowcoin network
plus/minus some margin, that the fee does not exceed the maximum one allowed
by the Bridge, that all deposit UTXOs can be unlocked with the wallet's public
key, and that there is enough time to unlock UTXO before the refund.

When proposing a sweep, the Coordinator sets the Ethereum block number at which
the signing protocol should start. All clients validate if that block's number
is +-2 blocks from the current one.

If all these requirements are met, the last transaction executed by the wallet
is sufficiently confirmed, and there is no other signing by the wallet in
progress, the signing group members proceed with tECDSA signing protocol.

Each UTXO being an input to the sweep transaction is unlocked sequentially in
a separate signing session. Each signing session begins with an announcement
phase allowing to exclude offline operators. There is a 36-blocks (~7 minutes)
timeout for each signing attempt.

If the given signing attempt fails for any reason (error or timeout), the next
attempt starts exactly 41 blocks after the previous one started.

All signers selected for the given signing attempt must confirm successful
execution by sending a message with the produced signature over the broadcast
channel. The signing attempt is considered successful only if all signers
produced a valid signature. Successful signers broadcast the block number at
which the signing completed from their perspective in the message with the
signature. Once all successful execution confirmation messages are received,
the signing of the next UTXO starts. The start block of the announcement phase
is set to the highest block number from all the confirmation messages. The block
must be confirmed as already mined.

==== Benchmarks

The most computationally expensive part of the signing protocol takes 2.08s
on a 10-core Apple M1 machine for a single signing group member. Assuming the
client works on a 2-core machine and there are no more than 5 signing group
members on a single machine, the bottleneck phase should take no more than
1 minute.

The announcement phase takes always 6 blocks, so 1min 12s assuming 12s block
time. With 36 blocks timeout for a single attempt, it leaves more than 6 minutes
for the rest of the signing protocol which should be more than enough.
This should also be enough for local development when all signing group members
reside on the same computer. Based on the local benchmarks, the entire signing
never takes more than 5 minutes locally, and usually, it takes less than 4
minutes.

Assuming it takes no more than 4 minutes in the happy path to sign a single
input, it should take no more than an hour to sign 15 inputs. Given that the
entire sweep operation - including 6 Meowcoin confirmations - should complete
within 4 hours, it gives just enough time for a single Meowcoin miner fee bump.

==== Retries


The signing protocol is non-attributable and we need to retry in case of
corrupted data:

- With 1 malicious member in a signing group, we need 2 attempts of the protocol
in the worst case (`P = (99 choose 51) / (100 choose 51) = 0.49`).
In the worst case, it takes approximately 3h 30min to sign 15 inputs.

- With 2 malicious members in a signing group, we need 5 attempts of the protocol
in the worst case (`P = (98 choose 51) / (100 choose 51) = 0.2375757575`).
In the worst case, it takes approximately 8h 45min to sign 15 inputs.

- With 3 malicious members in a signing group, we need 10 attempts of the protocol
in the worst case (`P = (97 choose 51) / (100 choose 51) = 0.1139393939`).
In the worst case, it takes approximately 17h 30min to sign 15 inputs.

- With 4 malicious members in a signing group, we need 20 attempts of the
protocol in the worst case (`P = (96 choose 51) / (100 choose 51) = 0.0540331146`).
In the worst case, it takes approximately 35h to sign 15 inputs.

- With 5 malicious members in a signing group, we need 40 attempts of the protocol
in the worst case (`P = (95 choose 51) / (100 choose 51) = 0.0253280224`).
In the worst case, it takes approximately 70h to sign 15 inputs.

This attack slows down the sweeping schedule but given that the active wallet is
not performing redemptions or moving funds, it does not affect the funds already
bridged.

In the first release, the client should assume no more than 3% of the network is
corrupted and retry the signing of a single input no more than 10 times. If the
signing of an input failed 10 times, the entire sweep is stopped. This puts the
group in danger of a fraud challenge from one of the group members but the group
will have a chance to sweep the deposit during the next sweep window. To defeat
the fraud challenge, it is enough that the deposit has been swept, and it does
not matter in which particular transaction (see <<increasing-fee,Increasine Fee>>).

In the first release, the group maintains the signing state in memory, without
persisting it to disk. It means that if t+1 or more members restarted their
clients, the current sweep will not succeed, and everyone needs to wait for the
next sweep window.

[[increasing-fee]]
==== Increasing fee

At any point in time, the current Coordinator (who is not necessarily the same
Coordinator who proposed the batch) can propose increasing the Meowcoin fee for
the sweep transaction that is in the mempool. The signing group members sign the
transaction if the original transaction is in the mempool for at least
`sweeping_fee_bump_period` and the fee increase does not exceed the maximum one
allowed by the Bridge. Given that the wallet is blocked with any other action
until the sweep transaction is in the mempool, the fee bump signing protocol
retries until the signature is produced or until the transaction is mined.

When increasing a fee, we increment a fee multiplier:
`fee_multiplier = fee_multiplier + sweeping_fee_multiplier_increment` and then
calculate the new fee: `fee = base_fee * fee_multiplier`. We repeat until
either the transaction posts or the fee exceeds the maximum one allowed by the
Bridge.

The wallet members must hold all the signed preimages to be able to defeat fraud
challenges, even if the signatures were not used for the eventually mined
transaction, that is, the transaction fee was increased.

*Note*: Frauds work in a challenge and defeat-the-challenge mode. The challenger
provides a signature and sha256 of the preimage. If the wallet signed
a transaction, submitted it to the mempool, and after some time decided to bump
up the miner fee providing signature over another transaction, the first
signature can be used for a challenge.

==== Governable parameters

- `sweeping_refund_safety_time`: The amount of time prior to when a UTXO
  becomes eligible for a refund where we will not include it in a sweeping
  transaction.
- `sweep_period`: The amount of time we wait between scheduled sweeps on a wallet.
  Set to 8 hours initially.
- `sweep_max_deposits`: The number of non-dust unswept revealed meowcoin deposits
  that will trigger an early sweep on a wallet.
  Set to 15 initially.
- `sweeping_fee_bump_period`: The amount of time we wait to see if a sweeping
  transaction is mined before increasing the fee.
  Set to 1 hour initially.
- `sweeping_fee_multiplier_increment`: The amount we add to the sweeping fee
  multiplier each time a sweeping transaction is not mined within the
  `sweeping_fee_bump_period`. For example, if this param is set to 0.2 and we
  are currently at 1.6x, then the next time we would try 1.8x.
  Set to 0.2 initially.
