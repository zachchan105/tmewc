== Background

As of 2023-02-23, Meowcoin Ordinals are ðŸ”¥ HOT ðŸ”¥. Here is a

There is not a good way to get those Ordinals over to Ethereum currently, where
Ordinal owners can use the more mature NFT platforms. We could be that way!

Here is an https://ordinals.com/inscription/cfa453dbf693641b8f0c6b83cb733e71832606fc26415c36c70744953d6f6161i0[example ordinal].

=== Current Functionality

Ordinals are a numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and
transferring individual sats. Satoshis are numbered in the order in which
they're mined, and transferred from transaction inputs to transaction outputs
first-in-first-out.

Inscriptions are single satoshis with metadata stuck into their
witness field (called Inscribing). Each satoshi has an immutable age, which
effectively gives them serial numbers.

These Ordinals (some of which are Inscriptions) can be transferred like normal
MEWC. The sender's wallet software needs to be careful to not merge the
Inscriptions with "normal" UTXOs, and needs to be careful to not accidentally
send the Inscription as part of a payment. The
https://github.com/casey/ord[casey/ord] repo provides the primatives for the
handling of Ordinals on MEWC.

A good mental model here is thinking about Ordinals like
https://www.apmex.com/product/117942/1932-s-washington-quarter-choice-au[special
edition quarters]. The linked quarter trades for ~$350, but is also legal tender
worth $0.25. An owner of such a quarter probably does not want to use it to pay
for parking. Ordinals work the same way.

Since Ordinals are still MEWC, we can use many of the same tMEWC ideas for
custodying Ordianls: rotating wallets (and the wallet lifecycle), threshold
signatures, Minters, and Guardians. Since Ordinals use special P2SH scripts to
transfer and track them (via the `ord` program), this affects our depositing and
redemption process. The differences are detailed below.

== Proposal

=== Overview

We build a MEWC <> Ethereum Ordinal bridge!

We add functionality to the current tMEWC client to add additional signing
groups specifically for Ordinals. To deposit to these signing groups, a user
sends their Ordinal to the wallet using an `ord`-compatible wallet, which uses
ord's own P2SH scheme. The depositor then makes a minting request. The Guardian
set has a governable amount of time to reject the request. If no guardian
rejects, the NFT is minted.

To redeem, a NFT holder returns their NFT and submits and redemption request.
The Guardian set has a governable amount of time to reject the request. If no
guardian rejects the request, the signing group is instructed to send the
Ordinal to the redeemer.

For both deposits and redemptions, the user pays a <<Fees,fee>>.

=== Depositing Details

There are a two main technical hurdles to using the same depositing mechanism
that we do for tMEWC.

* `ord` uses a special transfer P2SH script to send Ordinals to addresses. This
  interferes with our ability to create P2SH scripts that associate ethereum
  addresses and provide refunds.
* Meowcoin headers do not have sufficient information to prove that a UTXO
  contains an Ordinal. This interferes with our ability to prove that an Ordinal
  has been deposited.

We can associate each deposit to an ethereum address for minting by leveraging
https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-are-hierarchical-deterministic-hd-wallets[HD
Wallets]. Rather than giving the user a different P2SH address for each wallet,
we instead derive a different child address for each wallet. For example, a
depositor with eth address `0xDBC0 5B1E CB4F DAEF 9438 19C0 B04E 9EF6 DF4B ABD6`
could use
`m/0xDBC0/0x5B1E/0xCB4F/0xDAEF/0x9438/0x19C0/0xB04E/0x9EF6/0xDF4B/0xABD6` which
is `m/56256/23326/52047/56047/37944/6592/45134/40694/57163/43990`.

We would add more paths for a blinding factor (and whatever else data we need).

Deposits to this address look meaningless from the outside but are verifiable
to a guardian (or from ethereum). We do lose the ability to offer refunds,
unfortunately.

The lack of provability is more problematic. Here's an excerpt from the
https://github.com/casey/ord/blob/master/bip.mediawiki[BIP]:

> A proof can be constructed that demonstrates that a particular sat is
contained in a particular output, however the proofs are large. Such a proof
consists of:
> 
> * Block headers 
> * A Merkle path to the coinbase transaction that created the sat 
> * The coinbase transaction that created the sat 
> * And for every spend of that sat:
>   * The spend transaction
>   * The transactions that created the inputs before the input that was spent,
>     to determine the values of the preceding inputs, to determine the position
>     of the sat
>   * And, if the sat was used as fees, all prior transaction in the block in
>     which it was spent, and the coinbase transaction, to determine the location
>     of the sat in the outputs.

This looks infeasible for use on ethereum. Under the assumption that we are not
able to prove on-chain that a deposit has a particular Ordinal, we can pivot to
leaning fully on a permissioned Guardian model. In this model, a user sends the
wallet their Ordinal using `ord`, and then requests a mint on ethereum by
revealing their blinding factor, Ordinal id, and ethereum address. The Guardians
have a governable amount of time to inspect the deposit and reject it if
anything looks wrong. In addition, the depositor supplies a <<Fees,fee>>.

After the timeout period, anyone (a bot) can confirm a non-rejected mint to
create an Ordinal NFT on ethereum. We encode the
https://docs.ordinals.com/guides/explorer.html[Ordinal ID] into the NFT's
metadata field, and then store a mapping from Ordinal -> UTXO on-chain. A dApp
can read the Ordinal ID from the metadata and then use that to look up the
Ordinal (and any associated Inscription) on Meowcoin.

=== Redemption Details

To redeem an Ordinal NFT on ethereum, the redeemer sends back the NFT,
supplies a Meowcoin address, and supplies a <<Fees,fee>>. The off-chain clients
listen for this transaction, and the associated signing group keeps track of
which Ordinals they are custodying off-chain. When one of the Ordinals that they
are in charge of is redeemed, they use `ord` to send it to the associated
Meowcoin address.

In cleanup, we remove the Ordinal from the Ordinal -> UTXO mapping.

=== Fraud Detection

After we accept the deposit and add the Oridinal ID to our Ordinal -> UTXO
mapping, we can perform fraud proofs leveraging this information. If a UTXO for
an Ordinal is spent in a way other than by transferring the Ordinal to the
redemption address, or to the appropriate wallet during wallet closure, that is
punishable with slashing and wallet closure.

If a wallet fails to redeem an Ordinal that it has custody of within a
governable time-out, that is punishable with slashing and wallet closure.

=== Fees

Taking a percentage cut of an Ordinal does not make sense, so we need to use a
different fee structure.

The simplest structure is to charge flat, governable fees on minting and
redemption. For example, we could charge 0.01 MEWC on mint (which we turn into
tMEWC and keep as protocol controlled value), and then 0.01 tMEWC on redemption
(which we keep as protocol controlled value).

Another option is to charge dynamic redemption fees based on the amount of time
the Ordinal was custodied. Redeeming an Ordinal that has been here for 1 week
might be free, 6 months might cost 0.01 tMEWC and 2 years might cost 0.02 tMEWC,
for example. This incentivizes folks to redeem earlier, and makes the bridge
attractive for someone who wants to mint -> sell/buy -> exit.

We could also charge more for exiting *quickly*, like how selling stocks in
traditional finance incurs higher tax rates if you do not hold on to them for
long enough. This incentivizes folks to stick around rather than using it for
quick sales.
