== Background

tMEWC requires a threshold signature scheme recognised by MEWC.
Until 2021 ECDSA was the only available option,
but with the introduction of Taproot we now have the option of using Schnorr signatures instead.
Schnorr signatures enable significantly easier attributability of misbehaviour during signing.

=== Current functionality

The protocol currently used in tMEWC (GG18) does not provide attributability
when signing fails due to one or more members misbehaving.
Because of this, the only solution is to retry the signing
until a set of signers with no misbehaving participants is stumbled upon.
This means that even a small group of misbehaving participants
can cause a dramatic slowdown in signing,
rendering the system vulnerable to severe DoS attacks.

Previously, the goal was to replace GG18 with CGGMP21,
which has attributable misbehaviour at the cost of significant implementation complexity.

== Proposal

Replace ECDSA with Schnorr signatures,
enabling the use of ROAST with FROST threshold signatures instead of CGGMP21.
Use link:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-006-0347-3[GJKR]
for distributed key generation of signature shares for FROST.

This reduces the complexity of key generation,
and makes signature production significantly simpler and faster
while providing the attributability missing from the current tECDSA implementation.

=== Requirements

The Taproot upgrade for Meowcoin enabled Schnorr signature support in 2021.
BIP-340 defines these Schnorr signatures,
and our implementation must conform to it.

Schnorr signatures are incompatible with existing Meowcoin scripts,
requiring the use of taproot scripts instead.

This would introduce one user-facing change:
refund addresses would have to be bech32m P2TR addresses
rather than legacy address types.

=== BIP-340

link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki[BIP-340] defines Schnorr signatures for the curve secp256k1,
already widely used in Meowcoin.
A signature for message m and public key point P
is defined as the (point, scalar) pair `(R, s)`
where `s * G = R + hash(R || P || m) * P`.

The points P and R are encoded as the X-coordinate,
and the Y-coordinate is defined to be even.
This gives a 32-byte encoding
that corresponds to the standard 33-byte compressed format with the prefix `0x02`.

The hash function for BIP340 signatures `hash(tag, x)` is defined as
`SHA256(SHA256(tag) || SHA256(tag) || x)`
where tag is a context-dependent domain separator.

For our purposes, we will consider the verification specification:

Input:

* The public key pk: a 32-byte array
* The message m: a 32-byte array
* A signature sig: a 64-byte array

The algorithm `Verify(pk, m, sig)` is defined as:

* Let `P = lift_x(int(pk))`; fail if that fails.
* Let `r = int(sig[0:32])`; fail if `r ≥ p`.
* Let `s = int(sig[32:64])`; fail if `s ≥ n`.
* Let `e = int(hash(BIP0340/challenge, bytes(r) || bytes(P) || m)) mod n`.
* Let `R = s⋅G - e⋅P`.
* Fail if `is_infinite\(R)`.
* Fail if not `has_even_y\(R)`.
* Fail if `x\(R) ≠ r`.
* Return success iff no failure occurred before reaching this point.

For every valid secret key `sk` and message `m`, `Verify(PubKey(sk),m,Sign(sk,m))` will succeed.

We see that the signature is a concatenation of
a 32-byte x-coordinate or a curve point R,
and a 32-byte scalar s.
The hash function uses the tag `BIP0340/challenge`.

=== BIP-341 & BIP-342

link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki[BIP-341]
and link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki[BIP-342]
define the Taproot outputs and scripting, respectively.

----
A Taproot output is a native SegWit output with version number 1,
and a 32-byte witness program.
----

The witness program `q` represents a BIP-340 public key,
and the output is constructed like a link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#p2wsh[P2WSH] output
except the version byte is `0x01` instead of `0x00`.

Taproot outputs can be spent with either a signature for the key `q`,
or a script `s` and an associated control block `c`
matching link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#script-validation-rules[the following rules]:

----
* Let `q` be the 32-byte array containing the witness program
(the second push in the scriptPubKey)
which represents a public key according to BIP340.

* Fail if the witness stack has 0 elements.

* If there are at least two witness elements,
and the first byte of the last element is `0x50`,
this last element is called annex `a` and is removed from the witness stack.
The annex (or the lack of thereof) is always covered by the signature
and contributes to transaction weight,
but is otherwise ignored during taproot validation.

* If there is exactly one element left in the witness stack, key path spending is used:

** The single witness stack element is interpreted as the signature
and must be valid (see the next section) for the public key `q` (see the next subsection).

* If there are at least two witness elements left, script path spending is used:

** Call the second-to-last stack element `s`, the script.

** The last stack element is called the control block `c`, and must have length `33 + 32m`,
for a value of `m` that is an integer between 0 and 128, inclusive.
Fail if it does not have such a length.

** Let `p = c[1:33]` and let `P = lift_x(int(p))` where `lift_x` and `[:]` are defined as in BIP340.
Fail if this point is not on the curve.

** Let `v = c[0] & 0xfe` and call it the leaf version[7].

** Let `k0 = hashTapLeaf(v || compact_size(size of s) || s)`; also call it the tapleaf hash.

** For `j in [0,1,...,m-1]`:

*** Let `ej = c[33+32j:65+32j]`.

*** Let `kj+1` depend on whether `kj < ej` (lexicographically):

**** If `kj < ej`: `kj+1 = hashTapBranch(kj || ej)`.

**** If `kj ≥ ej`: `kj+1 = hashTapBranch(ej || kj)`.

** Let `t = hashTapTweak(p || km)`.

** If `t ≥ 0xFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141` (order of secp256k1), fail.

** Let `Q = P + int(t)G`.

** If `q ≠ x(Q)` or `c[0] & 1 ≠ y(Q) mod 2`, fail.

** Execute the script, according to the applicable script rules,
using the witness stack elements excluding the script s, the control block c,
and the annex a if present, as initial stack.
This implies that for the future leaf versions (non-0xC0) the execution must succeed.

q is referred to as taproot output key and p as taproot internal key.
----

The way key `q` is constructed
means that every Taproot spend has essentially a "backdoor"
for the holder of the secret key corresponding to `p`.
This allows the simplification of scripts
where one of the spending conditions is a simple signature.

=== FROST

link:https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-12.html[FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)] signing protocol
is a protocol for generating valid Schnorr signatures for a public key PK
which corresponds to a secret key sk shared among n participants using Shamir's method.

==== Compatibility with BIP-340, 341 & 342

===== BIP-340

These signatures are of the form (R, z) where R is a curve point and z a scalar,
and are verified against a public key PK and message msg as follows:

....
  prime_order_verify(msg, sig, PK):

  Inputs:
  - msg, signed message, a byte string.
  - sig, a tuple (R, z) output from signature generation.
  - PK, public key, an Element.

  Outputs:
  - True if signature is valid, and False otherwise.

  def prime_order_verify(msg, sig = (R, z), PK):
    comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
    challenge_input = comm_enc || pk_enc || msg
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    l = G.ScalarBaseMult(z)
    r = R + G.ScalarMult(PK, c)
    return l == r
....

Compared to BIP340,
we see that the point R matches in both,
and the scalar z of FROST corresponds to the scalar s of BIP340.

After accounting for encoding differences,
we see that the hash function `H2` producing the challenge c
must match the hash of BIP340 used to compute the scalar e.
This is the only required deviation from FROST as specified.
Otherwise an examination of the protocols
will show that a FROST-generated signature would pass BIP340 verification.

===== BIP-341

The Taproot output key `q` is produced by `q = Q.x; Q = P + tG`
for a constant `t` determined by `P` and the script used.

For a public key `P = skG`, the secret key `sk'` matching `Q = sk'G`
is calculated by `sk' = sk + t`.

Because FROST uses Shamir's polynomial secret sharing,
individual participants' secret key shares are points on a polynomial
whose constant term equals `sk`.
Thus adding `t` to each secret key share yields a new polynomial
whose constant term equals `sk'`.
Similarly, each secret key share's corresponding public key share
can simply have `tG` added to it for the purpose of verification.

This makes adaptation of FROST to produce signatures for Taproot output keys simple.

BIP-341 link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#common-signature-message[also defines]
how the message to be signed is computed.
This determines the `msg` but has no direct bearing on FROST.

===== BIP-342

link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki#signature-validation[BIP-342]
defines signature verification rules
that only apply when using a script path spend.

These rules affect the refund path of tMEWC deposits
but aren't directly relevant for FROST
which simply produces signatures for the BIP-341 Taproot output key.

==== Protocol

FROST is a two-round protocol for generating t-of-n threshold Schnorr signatures
with the help of a semi-trusted coordinator (Alice).

In the first round, each participant (Bobs) produces a pair of commitments
and sends them to the coordinator Alice.

After the Alice has acquired a sufficient number of commintments,
she assembles a set of commitments from exactly t Bobs,
and sends it to those same Bobs, along with the message to sign.

In the second round, each Bob calculates his signature share
using his secret key share, and the message and commitment list sent by Alice.
The Bobs then send their signature shares to Alice.

Once Alice has received signature shares from all t Bobs,
she can aggregate them into a signature candidate.
If the signature candidate is not valid,
Alice can verify each signature share sent by the Bobs
and identify at least one misbehaving Bob
who sent an invalid share.
If Alice is misbehaving,
she can prevent the signature candidate from being created,
but can learn no secret information.

A more detailed specification of the FROST protocol
is found in the draft RFC https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-12.html

=== ROAST

link:https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550.pdf[ROAST (Robust Asynchronous Schnorr Threshold Signatures)]
is a wrapper for FROST specifying how to deal with misbehaving participants.

In ROAST, Alice begins by requesting commitments from all Bobs.
As she receives valid messages from Bobs,
she adds those Bobs to the list of responsive signers R.

Whenever there are t Bobs in R,
Alice assembles their commitments, asks them to produce a signature share,
and removes them from R.

When a Bob produces a signature share,
he also produces new commitments and sends them to Alice alongside the share.

When Alice receives a valid signature share and commitment from a Bob,
she adds that Bob back to R.
When Alice receives an invalid signature share from a Bob,
she does not add that bob back to R.
As a result, misbehaving or unresponsive Bobs
are eventually excluded from the executions of the FROST protocol,
and a valid signature will inevitably be produced by some set of Bobs
assuming at least t Bobs are honest, Alice is honest,
and all messages between Alice and Bobs are eventually delivered.

To avoid the dependency on Alice's honesty,
the signers can choose (n - t + 1) Alices from among themselves,
ensuring that if at least t signers are honest
at least one Alice must also be honest and the protocol must succeed.

=== Compatibility with tMEWC

The only way to use BIP-340 Schnorr signatures is with Taproot,
which breaks compatibility with existing addresses and scripts.
Only bech32m P2TR addresses using Schnorr signatures are accepted in Taproot outputs,
but Taproot outputs can be spent into legacy addresses.

Most importantly, this means that the refund address provided when depositing MEWC
must be a bech32m P2TR address, as it would be used from a Taproot script.

Redemptions can still be paid to legacy addresses;
only the change output remaining in the wallet has to be Taproot.

==== Script changes

===== Deposit

Tapscript allows the definition of separate script paths,
but most importantly we can use the wallet's public key
as the script's internal public key,
simplifying deposit scripts to only cover the refund path.

Current deposit script:
....
<depositorAddress> DROP
<blindingFactor> DROP
DUP HASH160 <walletPubKeyHash> EQUAL
IF
  CHECKSIG
ELSE
  DUP HASH160 <refundPubkeyHash> EQUALVERIFY
  <refundLocktime> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
  CHECKSIG
ENDIF
....

Taproot refund path:
....
<depositorAddress> DROP
<blindingFactor> DROP
<refundLockTime> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
<refundPubkey> CHECKSIG
....

Corresponding opcodes (73 bytes total):
....
- 0x14: Byte length of depositor ethereum address
- <depositor address>
- 0x75: OP_DROP
- 0x08: Byte length of blinding factor
- <blinding factor>
- 0x75: OP_DROP
- 0x04: Byte length of refund locktime value
- <refund lock time>
- 0xb1: OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
- 0x75: OP_DROP
- 0x20: Byte length of refund public key
- <refund pubkey>
- 0xac: OP_CHECKSIG
....

link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#constructing-and-spending-taproot-outputs[When spending a Taproot output with the key path],
wallet's public key is tweaked with a hash of the script.
This creates an effective commitment to the matching script
while saving on transaction fees due to the smaller witness of a key path spend.

===== Otherwise

Taproot P2TR scripts always consist of a push of the version byte `0x01`,
and the 32-byte plaintext public key `q`.

These can be constructed as follows:
....
bytes4 constant P2TR_PREFIX = bytes4(0x23010120) // script length 35, push 1 byte (version), 0x01, push 32 bytes (public key)

function makeP2TRScript(bytes32 q)
    internal
    pure
    returns (bytes memory)
{
    return (abi.encodePacked(P2TR_PREFIX, q); // prefix followed by public key q
}
....

==== Solidity changes

===== Wallet pubkeys

Wallets need to be identified by their 32-byte plaintext BIP-340 pubkeys,
rather than 20-byte pubkey hashes as they currently are.

===== MEWCUtils

`MEWCUtils.extractHash()` is incompatible with P2TR.
Due to the simplification of only needing to consider the P2TR case,
we can implement a unified `extractP2TRKey()` function instead:

....
function extractP2TRKey(bytes memory output) internal pure returns (bytes32 q) {
    uint256 scriptLen = output.length - 8;
    require(scriptLen == 36, "Invalid length for P2TR output");
    bytes4 prefix = output.slice4(8);
    require(prefix == P2TR_PREFIX, "Invalid prefix for P2TR output"); // "0x23010120"
    q = output.slice32(12);
    return q;
}
....

This function would take the role of `BitcoinTx.extractPubKeyHash()`
in P2TR contexts.

===== Deposit

When a user reveals a deposit,
the expected script needs to conform to the Taproot script,
and the refund pubkey must be an unhashed Schnorr pubkey.

The funding output's script is produced by taking the wallet's public key `p`
and applying a tweak corresponding to the correct refund script `s`.
The tweak is defined in link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#script-validation-rules[BIP-341],
and the presence of only one script path allows it to be slightly simplified:

....
P = lift_x(p)
k0 = hash("TapLeaf", v || compact_size(size of s) || s)
t = hash("TapTweak", p || k0)
(require t < order of secp256k1)
Q = P + int(t)G
q = Q.x
....

The size of `s` is always `73 = 0x49`, and the leaf version `v` must be `0xc0`.

To verify that the `q` of the output is correct for the claimed deposit,
we need to check that `P + tG == Q` which would be prohibitively expensive
in a naive implementation using on-chain scalar multiplication.

However, there exists a method to
link:https://ethresear.ch/t/you-can-kinda-abuse-ecrecover-to-do-ecmul-in-secp256k1-today/2384[use ECRECOVER to verify the result of a scalar multiplication].
Thus we can require that the depositor also provides the values
`P` and `Q` in the reveal transaction.
By calculating `t = hash("TapTweak", p || hash("TapLeaf", 0xc049 || s))`
we can simply verify the correctness of the scalar multiplication
and of the provided curve points,
at a dramatically lower gas cost:

....
require(Q.x == q && P.x == p) // check provided points match x-coordinates
require(P.y % 2 == 0) // check P evenness
require(isOnCurve(P) && isOnCurve(Q))
require(verifyEcBaseMul(ecSub(Q, P), t)) // verify that tG == Q - P
....

All in all, we get this:
....
struct DepositRevealInfo {
    // Index of the funding output belonging to the funding transaction.
    uint32 fundingOutputIndex;
    // The blinding factor as 8 bytes. Byte endianness doesn't matter
    // as this factor is not interpreted as uint. The blinding factor allows
    // to distinguish deposits from the same depositor.
    bytes8 blindingFactor;
    // The BIP-340 public key p of the deposit's wallet.
    bytes32 walletPubKey;
    // The wallet's public key in point form.
    Point P;
    // The deposit output key q in point form.
    Point Q;
    // The BIP-340 public key that can be used to make the deposit refund
    // after the refund locktime passes.
    bytes20 refundPubKey;
    // The refund locktime (4-byte LE). Interpreted according to locktime
    // parsing rules described in:
    // https://developer.meowcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html#locktime-and-sequence-number
    // and used with OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode as described in:
    // https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki
    bytes4 refundLocktime;
    // Address of the Bank vault to which the deposit is routed to.
    // Optional, can be 0x0. The vault must be trusted by the Bridge.
    address vault;
    // This struct doesn't contain `__gap` property as the structure is not
    // stored, it is used as a function's calldata argument.

===== Sweeping

Taproot uses plaintext Schnorr pubkeys,
not pubkey hashes.

tweak as follows:

....
function processDepositSweepTxOutput(
    BridgeState.Storage storage self,
    bytes memory sweepTxOutputVector
) internal view returns (bytes32 walletPubKey, uint64 value) {
    // ...
    // ...

    require(
        outputsCount == 1,
        "Sweep transaction must have a single output"
    );

    bytes memory output = sweepTxOutputVector.extractOutputAtIndex(0);
    walletPubKey = output.extractP2TRKey();
    value = output.extractValue();

    return (walletPubKey, value);
}
....

Propagate changes as required.

===== Redemption

We can use the output of `makeP2TRScript()` directly on the wallet's public key.
link:https://github.com/meowcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#cite_note-23[BIP-341 recommends a taproot commitment]
even if there is no script path,
but the public key being used here is not an aggregate of keys,
but rather a threshold protocol public key,
so the consideration of attacks against key aggregation don't apply.

Tweak link:https://github.com/keep-network/tmewc/blob/main/solidity/contracts/bridge/Redemption.sol#L824[Redemption.processRedemptionTxOutputs()]:

....
if (
    resultInfo.changeValue == 0 &&
    (outputScriptHash == processInfo.walletP2TRScriptKeccak) &&
    outputValue > 0
) {
    // If we entered here, that means the change output with a
    // proper non-zero value was found.
    resultInfo.changeIndex = uint32(i);
    resultInfo.changeValue = outputValue;
} else {
....

The wallet can mix Taproot and legacy outputs,
so we shouldn't have issues with compatibility.

===== Moving funds

All outputs of moving funds need to use Taproot scripts
matching the destination wallets' 32-byte public keys,
rather than legacy scripts referring to 20-byte hashes.

===== Fraud proofs

A fraudulent BIP-340 transaction would use a Schnorr signature.
An on-chain implementation of BIP-340 signature validation is needed.
Schnorr transactions are not compatible with other signature protocols,
so proving fraud by the existence of a Schnorr signature
for a wallet's public key and an unauthorised message
would be sufficient to detect (attempted) theft of funds by the wallet.

==== DApp changes

The DApp needs to produce P2TR deposits,
and require a bech32m refund address.
This is also a user-facing change.
The `q` of the output is calculated the same way as in Solidity.

For redemptions, legacy outputs can be specified.

==== Misbehaviour handling

ROAST and FROST are extremely robust against misbehaviour by participants.
Invalid messages can be simply ignored and their sender blocklisted by the recipient.
Validating a received message takes negligible time,
and if misbehaviour during protocol execution could be proved on-chain,
malicious participants could simply stop responding instead and appear inactive.
Thus there is very little motive to put in effort
to develop a way to speficically punish misbehaviour.

Because ROAST involves multiple concurrent runs of FROST,
participants must track data for individual runs
and match messages accordingly.

A coordinator may have multiple runs of FROST,
where they communicate with the threshold number of participants.
Thus they must track the state of every run they have started,
and associate incoming messages with the correct run.

A member has at most one run with each coordinator,
and will only be receiving messages from that run's coordinator.
The member must not reuse nonces between different calls to produce a signature share,
and must erase used nonces immediately.

== tMEWC-ROAST

The proposed adaptation of ROAST to produce BIP-340 compliant signatures
for the purpose of tMEWC will be called tMEWC-ROAST in this RFC.

tMEWC-ROAST has n = 100 participants in a signing group,
of whom t = 51 are required to cooperate to produce a signature.
The indices i of the members are in the range [1, 100]

=== DKG

The (51, 100) secret key for a tMEWC-ROAST signing group (aka wallet)
is produced using GJKR.

In the execution of the GJKR DKG protocol,
inactive and misbehaving operators are identified and removed from the wallet.

=== Signing

==== Coordinator selection

When a wallet is required to sign message msg in ethereum block `B`,
one coordinator `P_c` is selected
by taking the block number modulo the group size,
and choosing the member whose index matches this number;
`c = B % n = B % 100`.

`P_c` then executes the signing protocol as the coordinator.
If a valid signature is not produced by the time block `B+1` is mined,
another coordinator `P_c+1` is selected.
This continues until a valid signature is produced,
or until block B+99 when all members have become coordinators.

==== Execution

1. `P_c` sends everyone in the group a `coordinator(P_c, msg, t)` message.

2. When a member `P_i` receives a `coordinator(P_c, m, t)` message,
they check if they have privately listed `P_c` as being unreliable/malicious,
whether `m` is a valid message to sign,
whether `t` is the correct TapTweak hash for it,
and whether `P_c` has been selected as a coordinator yet.
If both checks are good, `P_i` sends `P_c` a message `commit(P_i, cc_i, m)`
where `cc_i` is commit data for the Frost protocol.
The commitments, alongside the matching private nonces `nc_i` are stored in
`commitments[hash(P_c || m)] = (nc_i, cc_i)`.
`P_i` does this to all coordinators `P_c` passing these checks.

3. When coordinator `P_c` receives a `commit(P_j, cc_j, m)` message,
they check if they consider `P_j` reliable
and whether `m` is the correct message to sign `m == msg`.
If these checks pass,
the commit message is added to the list of commitments `cs`.

4. Once there are at least 51 commitments in `cs`,
`P_c` chooses 51 members `Pks = [P_k1, ..., P_k51]`
based on which commitments were received first.
`P_c` then assembles the list `ks` consisting of the pairs
`[(P_k1, cc_k1), ..., (P_k51, cc_k51)]` from those members
and sends them to all in Pks as message `signRequest(P_c, ks, msg, t)`.
`P_c` also records the sent request as `requests[hash(ks)] = Pks`.

5. When a member `P_i` who has previously sent a commit message to `P_c`
receives a message `signRequest(P_c, ks, m, t)` from `P_c`
and `m` and `t` match the message `P_i` intended to sign and its TapTweak,
and `cc_i` in `ks` matches the commitment `P_i` made earlier
(check that `commitments[hash(P_c || m) == (_, cc_i)`),
`P_i` calculates  the signature share `s_i` and new commit data `cc'_i`,
and sends `P_c` the messages `sign(P_i, s_i, m, hash(ks))` and `commit(P_i, cc_i', m)`.
For this purpose, `P_i` adds `t` to their secret key share `sk_i' == sk_i + t`.
If every member performs this correctly,
the effect is the same as if `t` was added to the wallet's secret key
as adding a constant to a polynomial adds that same constant to all of its points.
The member `P_i` then erases `(nc_i, cc_i)` from `commitments` and goes on standby,
waiting to execute phase 5 again if another signing request comes from the same coordinator,
or phase 2 with a new coordinator.

6. When member `P_c` receives `sign(P_j, s_j, m, h)` from `P_j`,
they check if `P_j` was in list `Pks = requests[h]`.
If yes, they validate `s_j` and add it to the list of signature shares `sks = shares[h]`.
The validation is performed with a tweaked public key share `pk_j' == pk_j + tG`.
The coordinator simultaneously executes step 3 again with the `commit(P_j, cc_j', m)` message,
possibly following up with step 4 as well.
If `s_j` fails the validation,
`P_c` adds `P_j` to its list of bad participants, ignores `P_j`'s commit message,
and returns to step 3.

7. Once some sks has all 51 valid shares in it, `P_c` tries to assemble a signature `s`.
If the signature is successful, they send a `success(s, m)` message to all other members
so they know to abort the signing for `m`.
`P_c` can now clear all data used in the execution of the protocol.

8. When member `P_i` receives a message `success(s, m)` from any other member `P_j`,
they check if `s` is a valid signature for `m`,
and that `m` is the correct message to sign.
If `s` and `m` are valid, they stop executing whatever step they were in
and clear all data for the execution.
If `s` is invalid, `P_i` adds `P_j` to the list of bad participants.
If `m` is invalid but `s` is valid,
`P_i` should probably raise an alarm over the fraudulent signature
but in practice this shouldn't happen and is out of scope for this RFC.
