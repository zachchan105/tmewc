== Overview

=== Depositing

Stakers periodically create <<group-size,51-of-100>> ecdsa-backed wallets
to hold frozen MEWC assets to maintain account balances. Depositors send MEWC
funds to the most-recently-created-wallet by using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH)
which contains hashed information about the depositor's minting ethereum
address. Once the block is mined, the depositor reveals their desired ethereum
minting address to the ethereum chain. The bridge listens for these sorts
of messages and when it gets one, it checks the meowcoin network to make sure
the funds line up. If everything checks out, then we update your ethereum-side
account balance.

=== Redemption

A user with an account balance supplies a meowcoin address. The system decreases
their account balance and releases the equivalent amount of meowcoin to the user
from the redeeming meowcoin wallet.

The redeeming wallet will be determined by the system on chain via an upgradable
(by governance) contract. The initial implementation for this contract should
select the oldest wallet. Redemptions should be batched (details to be
determined) to both decrease fees and processing time.

One possible implementation for efficient on-chain calculation of the oldest wallet
is to store the wallet information in a tree similar to what we use for sortition
pools, ensuring that no matter how many wallets we have active, the cost of
finding a wallet is always logarithmic over the maximum number of wallets during
the system's lifetime.

The maximum redemption size is capped by the size of the largest wallet, and
any redemption bigger than that will need to be split into multiple
redemptions.

[[continuous-fees]]
=== Continuous Fees

The system is able to collect fees in the form of tMEWC when the MEWC is
deposited and when it is redeemed. Rather than paying operators at those two
instances we would prefer to pay them continuously. Since we do not have the
tMEWC to pay them with until we collect the redemption fee (and can't mint it
and maintain the peg), we must turn to another token. Instead, the system pays
operators in T tokens from a treasury funded by the T-token DAO and whenever it
collects tMEWC fees it uses those fees to buy T tokens back for its treasury.

=== Minting And Unminting

A user with a swept account balance can drain their account balance to mint TMEWC.
Similarly, a user can burn TMEWC to refill their account balance.

A user with a swept account balance can drain their account balance to redeem MEWC.

== In Depth

[[group-size]]
=== Group Size

Governable Parameters:

- `heartbeat`: The number of group members required for a
  <<heartbeat,heartbeat>> to be successful.

Non-Governable Parameters:

- `threshold`: The number of signers that can be controlled by the adversary
  before the key is in danger.
- `dkg`: The minimum number of members we're allowed to drop down to during the
  DKG group formation re-try period.
- `group_size`: The total size of the signing group.

`threshold < heartbeat < dkg < group_size`

*Note*: `threshold`, `dkg` and `group_size` are mission-critical, cornerstone
parameters for the system, and will be hardcoded into the bridge contract. If
we want to change these parameters, we will need to upgrade the bridge
contract.

The total gas cost for sortition increases linearly with group size by at least
20k gas per member (though, we think we can get this down to roughly 6k gas per
member in the happy path with some upcoming optimizations). Requiring more
signers to sign messages makes it harder for adversaries to take over the
group, but makes it so that the pool is less resilient to undelegation or
operators going offline. Raising `heartbeat` decreases the chance that you'll
not have enough signers to sign transactions, but decreases a wallets lifespan
and increases overhead. Lowering `dkg` increases the chance that we're able to
create a wallet successfully but gives us a wallet with potentially fewer
operators and a lower lifespan.

Also important is optics - even though a `group_size` of 70 with a `threshold`
of 40 is equally secure against being controlled by an adversary as a
`group_size` of 100 with a `threshold` of 50, it might not _feel_ as secure.
That perception may cause a decreased willingness to invest capital in the
system leading to less money going over the bridge, even though the fees are
less overall.

Since we don't have any workable data that allows us to reasonably estimate
costs (especially with regard to optics), I suggest we start the system out
at decent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)[schelling
point] of `group_size = 100`, `threshold = 50`, `heartbeat = 70`, `dkg = 90` and then let
governance adjust from there once we've gathered data from the system being used.

See link:rfc-2.adoc[RFC 2: tMEWC Group Selection and Key Generation] for a deeper dive here

=== Account Balances

The bridge is able to maintain a clean separation of concerns as well as provide the backbone
an extensible financial system rooted in meowcoin-on-ethereum by concerning itself _just_ with
how much meowcoin has gone over the bridge. We keep track of account balances like:
```
contract Balances {
  mapping(address => uint256) private unsweptBalances;
  mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
}
```

When meowcoin enters the system, the associated account's unsweptBalance
increases. When that deposit is swept, that amount is transferred to the balance.
_If_ a user decides to mint a TMEWC meowcoin from their balance, their balance
would be drained and a TMEWC token would be minted. When a user brings back TMEWC
to the system, the token is burned and the account balance increases. If the
user wants MEWC, they can drain their account balance to redeem it.

This more abstract design lets us not only do things like mint TMEWC by draining
account balances, but also move into other financial concepts like
meowcoin-collateralized loans or meowcoin-backed stablecoins.

Neither of the above concepts are in-scope for this RFC, but the important part
is that we want to make sure we're starting with the more flexible
account-balances design so that we're not stuck later.

=== Depositing

==== Deposit + Commitment

Once we know the active wallet's public key hash, the dApp can put together a
pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address to receive the funds. This script will be
unique to each depositor and will look like:

```
<eth-address> DROP
<blinding-factor> DROP
DUP HASH160 <signingGroupPubkeyHash> EQUAL
IF
  CHECKSIG
ELSE
  DUP HASH160 <refundPubkeyHash> EQUALVERIFY
  <locktime> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
  CHECKSIG
ENDIF
```

Since each depositor has their own ethereum address and their own blinding
factor, each depositor's script will be unique, and the hash of each depositor's
script will be unique.

In order to unlock the funds, one must provide the unhashed script, (which
means that they know the eth address and blinding factor), as well as an
unlocking script with a signature and public key. If the sig+pubkey matches the
signing group public key, the funds are able to be moved immediately. If the
sig+pubkey matches the refund public key, then the funds can be moved after 30
days (specified as `locktime`).

==== The Big Reveal

Governable Parameters:

- `sweep_period`: The amount of time we wait between scheduled sweeps on a wallet.

After the deposit transaction has been mined, the user is able to reveal their
ethereum address and blinding factor to the ethereum chain. The bridge listens
for these sorts of messages and when it sees one, is able to generate a script that
can spend the funds. Once successful, we increase the account's unswept balance
and charge a deposit fee.

Additionally and optionally, as a part of the reveal transaction, the user the
declare that they want their swept funds to be immediately minted into TMEWC.
This saves the user from having to make separate transactions or wait for a
sweep to occur before an additional transaction.

Second, we schedule an operation that batches all outstanding known-refundable
transactions together to be combined with the existing wallet output into a
single output. The frequency of this operation is the `sweep_period`. When this
<<sweeping,sweep>> occurs, we decrease the relevant accounts' unswept balances
and increase their balances. This disables any outstanding 30-day refunds.

==== Automated Refunds

A meowcoin transaction is an amount and a script. The script can be something as
simple as "these funds can be spent by wallet 0xabc", or in our case, as
complex as "these funds can be spent by wallet 0xabc but if they aren't spent
within 30 days they can be spent by wallet 0x123". This gives us the ability to
create deposits that automatically are refunded after 30 days if they aren't
<<sweeping,swept>>. Thus, if a user misfunds or they get cold feet (for any
reason), all they need to do is not submit their reveal and wait 30 days.

[[sweeping]]
==== Sweeping

Governable Parameters:

- `sweeping_refund_safety_time`: The amount of time prior to when a UTXO
  becomes eligible for a refund where we will not include it in a sweeping
  transaction.
- `sweep_period`: The amount of time we wait between scheduled sweeps on a wallet.
- `sweep_max_deposits`: The number of non-dust unswept revealed meowcoin deposits
  that will trigger an early sweep on a wallet.
- `dust_threshold`: The minimum meowcoin deposit amount for the transaction to
  be considered for a sweep.
- `base_mewc_fee_max`: The highest amount of MEWC that operators can
  initially propose as a fee for miners in a sweeping transaction.
- `sweeping_fee_bump_period`: The amount of time we wait to see if a sweeping
  transaction is mined before increasing the fee.
- `sweeping_fee_multiplier_increment`: The amount we add to the sweeping fee
  multiplier each time a sweeping transaction is not mined within the
  `sweeping_fee_bump_period`. For example, if this param is set to 0.2 and we
  are currently at 1.6x, then the next time we would try 1.8x.
- `sweeping_fee_max_multiplier`: The highest we will try to increment the fee
  multiplier to before giving up and picking a new base fee and different
  deposits to sweep.
- `mewc_fee_max`: The highest amount of MEWC that operators can eventually
  propose as a fee for miners for sweeping transaction.

The operators sign a transaction that unlocks all of the revealed deposits
above the `dust_threshold`, combines them into a single UTXO with the existing
UTXO, and relocks that transactions without a 30-day refund clause to same
wallet.  This has two main effects: it consolidates the UTXO set and it
disables the refund.

*Caveat*: We only include deposits in batches that have at least
`sweeping_refund_safety_time` their refund window. This prevents potential
attacks or corner cases where we create a transaction with a valid, unspent
input, but by the time we have signed that transaction, the depositor has
already submitted a refund to the mining pool. Giving ourselves this leeway
stops that from happening.  Once a deposit crosses that
`sweeping_refund_safety_time` threshold, the depositor should wait and then
refund their deposit.

*Caveat*: A wallet only sweeps deposits that were deposited while while the
wallet was either the youngest or second-youngest wallet. The dApp will only
point deposits to the youngest wallet, so any other wallet receiving deposits
is the result of funky custom user behavior. In those cases, the users will
need to wait 30 days for their refund.

This process is called a "sweep", and occurs after `sweep_period` has passed or
if enough deposits have accumulated according to `sweep_max_deposits`, whichever
comes first. Any deposit below `dust_threshold` is ignored, both for triggering 
a sweep as well as being included in a sweep.

The sweeping transaction will cost some amount of meowcoin based on what miners
are charging for the meowcoin fee in the current market conditions. The fee is
split in proportion to the number of UTXOs associated to each depositor. Once
the transaction is submitted to the meowcoin mempool, the miners will either
include it in a block within `sweeping_fee_bump_period` or not. If they don't,
then we increment a fee multiplier: `fee_multiplier = fee_multiplier +
sweeping_fee_multiplier_increment` and then calculate the new fee: `fee =
base_fee * fee_multiplier`. We repeat until either the transaction posts or
`sweeping_fee_multiplier_increment` exceeds `sweeping_fee_max_multiplier`.

*Note*: We do not allow users to specify a max mewc fee. When users deposit,
they're agreeing to be swept at whatever fee the operators decide is
appropriate (based on https://blockstream.info/api/fee-estimates). Operators
cannot pick a starting fee higher than `base_mewc_fee_max` and they can never
choose a fee higher than `mewc_fee_max`.

When the transaction clears, and the information has made its way
over the relay maintainer, then another transaction needs to be created to on
the ethereum side to update the account balances. The users unswept balances
are decreased, and their swept balances are increased (after paying their share
of the <<meowcoin-sweeping-fee,meowcoin sweeping fee>>).

This transaction will be expensive gas-wise, and can be submitted by anyone
with the motivation to do so. For more details on transaction incentives,
check out the <<transaction-incentives,dedicated section>>.

*Caveat*: The `sweeping_fee_bump_period` and `sweeping_fee_max_multiplier`
parameters should be constrained such that one sweep should either finish and
either post or fail before the next sweep is scheduled (via `sweep_period`) to
start. This is because sweeps include the main UTXO as one of the inputs, which
is the result of the previous sweep's output.

The main downside to this approach is that it can take, in the worst case, up
to `sweep_period` for a user to be able to mint TMEWC. To help
alleviate this, two suggestions:

1) We surface when the next scheduled sweep and the accumulation threshold
data is somewhere in the dApp. This allows users to feel a lot better about
when sweeps are happening, and feel better about when their funds will be
available. There is also something to be said about the marketing around
explaining that we're batching in order to reduce fees across the board for the
end user, which allows for the decentralized product to compete with the
centralized ones.

2) We allow users to request that their TMEWC is minted as soon as they have a
swept account balance. This makes it so they don't have to wait, check, and
come back later and mint.

Combining these ideas, a user would deposit some MEWC, reveal their eth address
and blinding factor, and then request that TMEWC gets minted ASAP. Checking the
dApp, they can see that they should expect TMEWC in their provided wallet
address in 3 hours with no further interaction.

===== How Frequently To Sweep

Governable Parameters:

- `sweep_period`: The amount of time we wait between scheduled sweeps on a wallet.
- `sweep_max_deposits`: The number of non-dust unswept revealed meowcoin deposits
  that will trigger an early sweep on a wallet.

We've established in the <<sweeping,sweeping>> section that we should sweep
whenever enough time has passed to exceed the `sweep_period` or whenever enough
deposits are in the queue according to `sweep_max_deposits`. If we sweep early 
because a lot of deposits have been revealed, then we don't "push back" our scheduled
`sweep_period` sweep. Rather, that sweep continues as planned, and if there
are no deposits with <<meowcoin-sweeping-fee,sweeping fee>> high enough to be
included in a sweep (maybe because they all got swept in the `sweep_max_deposits`
sweep), then we wait until the next sweep and repeat the process.

*Example*: We have a `sweep_period = 8 hours` and `sweep_max_deposits = 10`. At
13:00, a sweep just occurred, and the next is scheduled for 21:00. At 15:00, 13
deposits gets revealed which triggers a sweep due to `sweep_max_deposits`. Rather 
than pushing back the next scheduled sweep to 23:00, it remains at 21:00. If by 
21:00 there are any deposits with a high enough <<meowcoin-sweeping-fee,sweeping fee>>
to be included in a sweep, we do it. Otherwise, we schedule the next sweep for
05:00 the next day. The process repeats.

Here, we're making the tradeoff between reducing fees (having less frequent
batches) and increasing reliability from a user experience standpoint.

[[redemption]]
=== Redemption

Governable Parameters:

- `redemption_request_timeout_redeemer_bonus_multiplier`: The percentage of the
  notifier reward from the staking contract the redeemer receives in case of a
  redemption timeout.
- `redemption_request_timeout_slashing_amount`: The amount of stake slashed
  from each member of a wallet for a timed-out redemption request.
- `redemption_request_timeout`: The amount of time the wallet has to provide
  redemption proof.
- `redemption_treasury_fee`: The percentage of redeemed amount put aside as a
  treasury fee.
- `wallet_min_closure_mewc`: The smallest amount of MEWC a wallet can hold before
  we attempt to close the wallet and transfer the funds to a randomly selected
  wallet.

To initiate a redemption, a user with a swept balance > `x` supplies a meowcoin
address. Then, the system calculates the redemption fee `redemption_treasury_fee`,
and releases an amount of meowcoin `y` such that `x = y + redemption_treasury_fee`
to the supplied meowcoin address. The remaining `redemption_treasury_fee` is sold
by the system to buy back `T` tokens (more about this
process in the <<continuous-fees,fee section>>) to pay to the operators.

In the MVP version of the system, a redemption is capped at the amount of
meowcoin contained in the largest wallet. The wallet doing the redemption is
selected by the redeemer, but the dApp should suggest that this is the oldest
wallet that contains enough meowcoin to fulfil the redemption. If more MEWC needs
to be redeemed than there is in the largest wallet, then the user needs to
submit multiple redemptions. After a redemption, if the wallet has under
`wallet_min_closure_mewc` remaining, it transfers that MEWC to a randomly
selected wallet and <<closing-a-wallet,closes>>.

Each redemption request is identified by a concatenation of the wallet's pubkey
hash and redeemer's output hash (redeemer's MEWC address). Such an identifier
allows retrieving pending redemption requests in a gas-efficient way based on
information provided in the redemption proof. A consequence of this approach is
that the redeemer can not use the same redemption MEWC address when there is
already one redemption request pending from the given wallet. User experience
can be improved by the dApp by selecting the previous-oldest wallet without a
pending redemption request to the given MEWC address in case a new redemption is
requested before the pending one gets cleared out.

At a minimum, pending redemption request needs to capture the following
information:

- Expected range of value for redemption UTXO: needed to validate the amount
  released by the system when processing the redemption proof. Fees are
  governable and the expected amount redeemed needs to be captured at the moment
  of the redemption request.
- Ethereum address of the redeemer: in case anything goes wrong with the
  redemption, this address will be used to return the unprocessed balance.
- UNIX timestamp at which the redemption was requested: needed to validate
  redemption timeout.

There is a governable redemption request timeout value,
`redemption_request_timeout`. If redemption proof was not submitted and
timeout is exceeded, the wallet is slashed and balances are returned back to the
redeemer, no matter if Meowcoin was released or not. The system is as
decentralized as the least decentralized element of it. Redeemers need to have
certain guarantees provided by the smart contract and no external body should
judge if the Meowcoin was spent or not. It is the wallet's responsibility to
process redemption requests in time.

Just like in the case of sweeps, off-chain clients should wait for enough
redemption requests from the given wallet to accumulate and process them in
batches in order to minimize gas expenditure of redemption proofs. At the same
time, the redeemer does not care about the underlying mechanism and they want to
have their particular redemption request processed in time. Given that it is the
individual redemption request that is timing out and not the entire batch of
redemption requests, the wallet takes a certain risk on itself by waiting and
not processing individual redemption requests immediately. At the same time, in
case of a high number of redemption requests, the wallet is incentivized to
process them in batches to minimize the wait time for Meowcoin and Ethereum chain
confirmations between redemptions. To minimize the risk for the wallet and to do
not disincentivize it for waiting for enough redemption requests to accumulate,
the redemption timeout should be long enough, for example, 72 hours and ideally
even longer in the early days of the system.

In the case of a timed-out redemption request the wallet is ordered to move the
MEWC to another random wallet. The wallet that timed out on processing
redemption request can not be requested for another redemption. Operators are
slashed for a timeout but they continue to earn rewards.

==== Redemption proof

Based on the information provided in the submitted redemption proof, pending
redemption requests possibly satisfied by the proof should be retrieved and each
of them should be validated separately.

If a pending redemption request exists for every UTXO of the redemption
transaction but the main wallet UTXO, and MEWC value of each UTXO is within the
expected range, redemption proof is accepted and redeemed Meowcoin balances in
the Bridge are cleared out. It is important to note that timeout is not
validated in this function. That is, if the timeout was not reported, the wallet
can process the entire redemption proof successfully even though the timeout for
the oldest redemption request already passed.

If a pending redemption request for the given UTXO does not exist, and that
redemption request was not earlier reported as timed-out or fraudulent because
of the UTXO value not being within the expected range, the entire redemption
proof transaction should revert.

If the value of the given UTXO matching pending redemption request is not in the
expected range, this is a fraud, and the entire redemption proof transactions
should revert.

If a pending redemption request for the given UTXO does not exist but that
redemption request was earlier reported as timed-out, that UTXO is skipped, and
the redemption proof transaction gets accepted, assuming there are more UTXOs in
the redemption transaction.

Submit redemption proof function updates the main wallet UTXO. Meowcoin balances
in the bridge are cleared out for successfully processed redemption requests.

==== Redemption timeout

Redemption proof for the given timed-out redemption request is accepted and
processed unless that redemption request was reported as timed out. Anyone can
report redemption timeout but there is no reward or gas cost reimbursement for
doing it so only the redeemer is incentivized to report the timeout.

When redemption request timeout is reported, the redeemer receives their balance
back, no matter if the underlying Meowcoin was redeemed or not. Each wallet
member is slashed for `redemption_request_timeout_slashing_amount` and redeemer
receives a percentage of a misbehavior notifier reward, as specified in
`redemption_request_timeout_redeemer_bonus`. Redemption request is removed from
the list of pending redemption requests and it is marked as timed-out. This way,
when redemption proof gets submitted, the timed-out redemption request will be
skipped. This mechanism allows proving whatever can still be proved and
unblocking the wallet by updating its main UTXO.

The transaction must revert if the given redemption request was already reported
as timed out.

The wallet is ordered to move the MEWC to another random wallet and is no longer
accepting redemption requests.

==== Fraud Proof

=== Fraud Proofs

Governable Parameters:

- `fraud_slashing_amount`: The amount of stake slashed from each member of a
  wallet for a fraud.
- `fraud_notifier_reward_multiplier`: The percentage of the notifier reward from
  the staking contract the notifier of a fraud receives.
- `fraud_challenge_defend_timeout`: The amount of time the wallet has to defend
  against a fraud challenge.
- `fraud_challenge_deposit_amount`: The amount of ETH the party challenging the
  wallet for fraud needs to deposit.

For every UTXO spent by the wallet in an incorrect way, anyone should be able
to provide a fraud proof. Given that a Meowcoin transaction could be so large
that proving it on Ethereum would be impossible, fraud proofs need to be
processed with a challenge-response approach.

When a wallet unlocks a UTXO it needs to calculate a sighash and provide
a signature over that sighash, one for each unlocked UTXO. Fraud is reported
for a UTXO by providing a sighash along with the wallet's signature over that
sighash. From that moment, the wallet has a certain time to defend itself
against the challenge and prove that the UTXO was spent in an honest way.

UTXO unlocked by the wallet is spent in a fraudulent way if:

- that unlocked UTXO is a revealed deposit that was not proved as swept and
  can not be proved as swept, or
- that unlocked UTXO was not and is not the main wallet's UTXO.

The wallet is allowed to execute only transactions that are accepted by the
submit sweep proof, submit redemption proof, or submit funds migrated functions.
All other transactions are considered fraud. In other words, if the wallet signed
some UTXO, it needs to use that UTXO, and prove to the Bridge this is a valid
usage. If none of it happens within the `fraud_challenge_defeat_timeout` the
wallet has to defend against the challenge, this is considered a fraud.

The consequence of this approach is that we need to track all UTXOs spent by the
wallet next to the main wallet's UTXO:

```
// wallet pubkey hash to the current main's UTXO hash computed
// as keccak256(txHash | txOutputIndex | txOutputValue)
mapping(bytes20 => bytes32) public mainUtxos;

// spent main UTXO hash computed as keccak256(txHash | txOutputIndex)
mapping(bytes32 => bool) spentMainUTXOs
```

Note that this approach is stricter than just validating the public key in the
UTXO. For example, if we were considering that a collection of deposit UTXO’s
plus the main UTXO for the wallet unlocked using the wallet public key and
locked under a single UTXO using the same wallet public key is not a fraud but
a normal sweep, the Bridge would be susceptible to attacks when the malicious
wallet steals revealed deposits by sweeping them to another UTXO but not the main
UTXO known by the Bridge.

To protect against chain reorgs capable of causing good-faith transactions to be
indefensible against fraud proofs, the wallet needs to wait for enough block
confirmations before undertaking any action. There has to be a reasonable
compromise between finality and responsivity and suggested values are 6
confirmations on Meowcoin and 40 confirmations on Ethereum.

==== Submitting Fraud Challenge

Anyone should be able to submit a fraud challenge. At a minimum, the function
should accept the wallet's signature and the sighash uniquely identifying UTXO
unlocked by the wallet. The function should validate the wallet state to make
sure it's neither closed nor terminated. It should also validate if the signature
over the sighash is valid and if it belongs to the wallet.

The function should require the challenger to provide a deposit in ETH equal to
`fraud_challenge_deposit_amount` that is returned to the challenger once the fraud
is confirmed. If the wallet defends against the challenge, the deposit is sent
to the treasury. If the wallet does not defend against the challenge, the
challenger receives misbehavior notifier reward based on
`fraud_notifier_reward_multiplier` and the wallet gets slashed based on
`fraud_slashing_amount`.

==== Defending Against Fraud Challenge

Anyone can defend the wallet against the fraud challenge by submitting a transaction
preimage matching the challenged sighash and proving that transaction was valid to
the protocol.

The function allowing to defend against the challenge should first validate the
submitted preimage against challenged sighash and try to locate the revealed deposit
for the input corresponding to the sighash.

If there is a revealed deposit matching the sighash and that deposit was swept by the
Bridge, everything is fine and the wallet defended itself against the challenge.

If there is a revealed deposit matching the sighash and it was not yet swept by the
Bridge, the defend function should revert. The wallet should first submit the sweep
proof for that deposit and then call the defend function again.

If the revealed deposit does not exist, the defend function should check if the sighash
belongs to one of the wallet's spent UTXOs from `spentMainUTXOs` mapping. If it does,
everything is fine and the wallet defended itself against the challenge. If it
does not, the defend function reverts. The wallet should submit the redemption
proof and then, call the defend function again.

=== Wallet Lifecycle

Governable Parameters:

- `wallet_creation_period`: How frequently we attempt to create new wallets.
- `wallet_min_creation_mewc`: The minimum amount of MEWC an active wallet needs
  to have before we allow for the creation of a new active wallet.
- `wallet_max_age`: The oldest we allow a wallet to become before we transfer the funds
  to a randomly selected wallet.

A new wallet is created when enough time has passed as defined in
`wallet_creation_period` *AND* the wallet contains at least
`wallet_min_creation_mewc` mewc. To create a new wallet, a group of 100 operators
is selected from the pool of available operators using a process called
sortition. The probability that a particular operator is chosen is based on
their stake weight, which in turn is based on the number of `T` tokens they
have invested in the staking contract.

Once the operators have been selected from the sortition pool, they generate a
51-of-100 ecdsa signing group to handle the meowcoin key material per the
process described in link:rfc-2.adoc[RFC 2: tMEWC Group Selection and Key
Generation]. The group size may end up being smaller depending on retries.

As time passes and operators drop out of the system, a wallet becomes at risk
of being able to meet the 51-of-100 threshold to produce signatures.
Additionally, we want to avoid situations where operators are the custodians of
a wallet for extended periods. To avoid these issues, once a wallet is older
than the `wallet_max_age`, or if it drops below the liveness threshold (say,
below 70 on a <<heartbeat,heartbeat>>), we motion to
<<closing-a-wallet,transfer the funds>> to another randomly selected wallet.

Once a wallet no longer has funds and is not the primary wallet for new
deposits, it can be <<closing-a-wallet,closed>> and operators are no longer
required to maintain it.

[[closing-a-wallet]]
==== Closing A Wallet

Governable Parameters:

- `heartbeat`: The number of group members required for a
  <<heartbeat,heartbeat>> to be successful.
- `wallet_closure_timeout`: The amount of time that a wallet has to
  successfully move its funds to another wallet and inform the ethereum chain
  before it is at risk of punishment.
- `wallet_dust_leftover`: The smallest amount of mewc that we will transfer to
  another wallet when a wallet closes. Any amount under this is abandoned.
- `wallet_max_age`: The oldest we allow a wallet to become before we transfer
  the funds to a randomly selected wallet.
- `wallet_min_closure_mewc`: The smallest amount of mewc a wallet can hold before
  we attempt to close the wallet and transfer the funds to a randomly selected
  wallet.

When a wallet fails a <<heartbeat,heartbeat>> `consecutive_failed_heartbeats`
times, ends a <<redemption,redemption>> with less than `wallet_min_closure_mewc`
remaining, or exceeds the `wallet_max_age`, then a few different parties can
begin the process of closing it.

If the wallet failed a heartbeat, then the <<operator-only,first operator>>
posts a <<operator-only,reimbursable>> transaction to the ethereum chain
declaring an intention to close the wallet. If the wallet exceeds
`wallet_max_age` or the funds fall under `wallet_min_closure_mewc`, then
<<public-knowledge,the public>> can post that transaction. If the wallet failed
a redemption, then the public (probably the redeemer) can post a
<<punishment,punishment>> transaction.

If the balance is less than `wallet_dust_leftover`, we simply close the wallet
and abandon the funds, signaling this with a <<public-knowledge, public>>
transaction, and can maintain the peg via a <<donate,donation>>.
Otherwise, we attempt to move the funds to other active wallet(s).

The first operator posts a signed, <<operator-only,reimbursable>>
`intention-to-move` transaction to the ethereum chain declaring which wallets
the operators intend to move the funds to. We trust the wallet to do this
correctly, because if it was malicious, it has little reason to not just steal
the funds. Then, that operator proposes a MEWC fee (as in <<sweeping,sweeping>>)
and the operators transfer the funds evenly between the wallets proposed in the
`intention-to-move` transaction. They construct a P2PKH transaction moving the
wallet's main UTXO to each of those wallets. For more details on exactly how a
wallet is chosen and how the funds are split up see
<<wallet-closure-transaction,the dedicated section>>.

After this transaction is complete, <<public-knowledge,the public>> is able to
submit a SPV proof to let ethereum know that the funds were transferred
nonfraudulently (they match the `intention-to-move` wallets, the fee isn't too
high, and the funds are split evenly). Later, a <<donate,donation>> can be
made by governance to handle any difference in outstanding v2 token supply and
locked MEWC due to mining transfer fees.

*Notes*: Transferring the MEWC to any address other than the P2PKH of one of the
other wallet addresses is fraud, and is <<Punishment,punishable>>. Moving funds
without sending a follow-up proof is <<Punishment,punishable>>. Failure to
close a wallet that failed a <<heartbeat,heartbeat>> or fell below
`wallet_min_closure_mewc`, or exceeded `wallet_max_age` is
<<Punishment,punishable>>. Failure to complete the process before
`wallet_closure_timeout` has elapsed is <<Punishment,punishable>>.

Any unswept funds can be returned via the 30-day return script, though since
we're redeeming from the oldest wallet and only sweeping/depositing to the
newest wallets this hopefully won't come up often 🤞.

[[wallet-closure-transaction]]
===== Wallet Closure Transactions

Governable Parameters:

- `wallet_transfer_max`: The most amount of MEWC a wallet can transfer to a
  single other wallet during a wallet closure.

When a wallet <<closing-a-wallet,closes>>, if there is any amount of meowcoin
remaining, it needs to be transferred to another _live_ wallet. Our input to the
transaction is the closing wallet's main UTXO, and we create an equal sized
output for the `N` valid wallets, where `N = min(valid_wallets.size,
ceil(funds_to_transfer / wallet_transfer_max))`.

The destination wallets are chosen for their public key hash's modulus distance
to the closing wallet's public key hash (both represented as a number). Ties are
broken by the destination with the greater public key hash, and if we run out of
viable wallets, it is okay to reuse them (though we prefer not to).

For all the below examples, say that the public key hashes can range from 0 to
99 (mod 100). Wallet#43 Means that the PKH of the Wallet is 43. Real public key
hashes and their max mod values will be much higher in practice!

Exceeding Transfer Max Example:

- Wallet#90 with balance `250 MEWC` needs to close.
- `wallet_transfer_max = 100 MEWC`
- Live wallet options are Wallet#30, Wallet#80, Wallet#25, Wallet#15
- Calculate distances:
- Wallet#30 = min(90 - 30, 130 - 90) = min(60, 40) = 40
- Wallet#80 = min(90 - 80, 180 - 90) = min(10, 90) = 10
- Wallet#25 = min(90 - 25, 125 - 90) = min(65, 35) = 35
- Wallet#15 = min(90 - 15, 115 - 90) = min(75, 25) = 25

`N = min([Wallet#30, Wallet#80, Wallet#25, Wallet#15].size, ceil(250 / 100)) = min(4, ceil(2.5)) = min(4, 3) = 3`
Split the 250 MEWC 3 ways. Deposit 250/3 = 83 1/3 MEWC into Wallet#80, Wallet#15, and Wallet#25.

Under Transfer Max Example:

- Wallet#52 with balance `50 MEWC` needs to close.
- `wallet_transfer_max = 100 MEWC`
- Live wallet options are Wallet#13, Wallet#90, Wallet#59, Wallet#42
- Calculate distances:
- Wallet#13 = min(52 - 13, 113 - 52) = min(39, 61) = 39
- Wallet#90 = min(90 - 52, 152 - 90) = min(38, 62) = 38
- Wallet#59 = min(59 - 52, 152 - 59) = min(7, 93) = 7
- Wallet#42 = min(52 - 42, 142 - 52) = min(10, 90) = 10

`N = min([Wallet#13, Wallet#90, Wallet#59, Wallet#42].size, ceil(50/100)) = min(4, ceil(0.5) = min(4,1) = 1)`
Split the 50 MEWC 1 way. Deposit 50/1 = 50 MEWC into Wallet#59.

Tiebreak Example:

- Wallet#52 with a balance `13 MEWC` needs to close.
- `wallet_transfer_max = 100 MEWC`
- Live wallet options are Wallet#13, Wallet#60, Wallet#44, Wallet#75
- Calculate distances:
- Wallet#13 = min(52 - 13, 113 - 52) = min(39, 61) = 39
- Wallet#60 = min(60 - 52, 152 - 60) = min(8, 92) = 8
- Wallet#44 = min(52 - 44, 144 - 52) = min(8, 92) = 8
- Wallet#75 = min(75 - 52, 152 - 75) = min(23, 77) = 23

`N = min([Wallet#13, Wallet#60, Wallet#44, Wallet#75].size, ceil(13/100)) = min(4, ceil(0.13) = min(4, 1) = 1)`
Split the 13 MEWC 1 way. Since Wallet#60 is tied with Wallet#44 for the closest, we favor Wallet#60
because 60>44. Deposit 13/1 = 13 MEWC into Wallet#60.

Wallet Reuse Example:

- Wallet#35 with a balance `413 MEWC` needs to close.
- `wallet_transfer_max = 100 MEWC`
- Live wallet options are Wallet#20, Wallet#30
- Calculate distances:
- Wallet#20 = min(35 - 20, 120 - 35) = min(15, 85) = 15
- Wallet#30 = min(35 - 30, 130 - 35) = min(5, 95) = 5

`N = min([Wallet#20, Wallet#30].size, ceil(413/100)) = min(2, ceil(4.13)) = min(2, 5) = 2`
Split the 413 MEWC 2 ways. Deposit 413/2 = 206.5 MEWC into Wallet#30 and Wallet#20.

[[heartbeat]]
=== Heartbeats

Governable Parameters:

- `consecutive_failed_heartbeats`: The number of times a heartbeat can fail in
  a row that triggers a move to close the wallet.
- `failed_heartbeat_reward_removal_period`: The amount of time an operator is
  removed from reward eligibility after failing a heartbeat.
- `heartbeat`: The number of group members required for a heartbeat to successful.
- `heartbeat_block_length`: The number of ethereum blocks until the next heartbeat.
  If set to 40, then the signers sign every 40th block.

To make sure that older wallets are still accessible for redemption, we need to
perform heartbeats. The signing group signs a block when block count mod
`heartbeat_block_length` = 0 and then does _not_ publish the result. If there
are ever less than `heartbeat` operators that participate in the heartbeat, the
active operators record the inactive operators. If this happens a number of
times >= `consecutive_failed_heartbeats`, the operators take a union the
recorded _inactive_ operators, and an operator from among the active operators
posts a transaction to disable those inactive operators from receiving rewards
for `failed_heartbeat_reward_removal_period` amount of time. The active
operators move the remaining MEWC to another random wallet and
<<closing-a-wallet,close>> this wallet.

For the purposes of heartbeats, an operator that is currently unstaking (they
started their two-week undelegation period) does not count as a live heartbeat,
but also does not count as an inactive operator. Thus, operators who are
unstaking might cause a wallet to fail a heartbeat, but can still be around to
help move the funds to another wallet, and would not have their rewards turned
off.

To represent this, clients should monitor the ethereum chain for unstaking
events to keep track of which operators are active/unstaking. Unstaking
operators should continue to send heartbeats. Operators ignore heartbeats from
unstaking operators for the purposes of determining wallet liveness. Operators
*don't* ignore heartbeats from unstaking operators for determining reward
eligibility.

Moving the funds costs a meowcoin mining fee, as well as a transaction on the
ethereum side to prove this happened. To maintain the peg, we need to reduce
the equivalent amount of fee from the treasury's account balance (set aside for
such fees). This will need to be proven and updated ethereum-side, and
<<transaction-incentives,properly incentivized>>.

*Example:*: Say that `heartbeat = 70, consecutive_failed_heartbeats = 1`.
Operator-1 through Operator-72 are all active while Operator-73 through
Operator-100 are inactive. Currently, there are 72 active operators, so the
heartbeat check is passing. Then, Operator-25 through Operator-30 decide to
unstake. Since unstaking operators do not count as a live heartbeat, there
would only be 67 heartbeats, and the wallet would begin to transfer its funds.

An operator from Operator-1 through Operator-72 (including 25-30) chooses to
publish that Operator-73 through Operator-100 should have their rewards
disabled (after the active operators sign this). See
<<transaction-incentives,transaction incentives>> for more on how to encourage
this transaction.

[[donate]]
=== Bridge Donation

If a wallet committed fraud, there has to be a function allowing to "donate" MEWC
to the Bridge without increasing anyone's balances. This function needs to
validate SPV proof of the donate transaction and update the main wallet UTXO.
This function should also be used to donate the Bridge to compensate for Meowcoin
fees burned on moving funds between wallets that failed a heartbeat.

The MEWC to donate needs to come from the coverage pool funds. The DAO - or some
delegate of the DAO - should be able to claim the coverage from the pool and
manually liquidate tokens to acquire MEWC and donate it to the Bridge.

[[transaction-incentives]]
=== Transaction Incentives

Governable Parameters:

- `max_gas_refund_price`: The highest amount of gwei that the gas refund
  contract will pay out per gas for a refund transaction.

Transaction incentives are more deeply explored in link:rfc-6.adoc[RFC 6:
Transaction Incentives]. Summarized:

There are three different types of transactions: <<operator-only,Operator-Only>>,
<<public-knowledge,Public-Knowledge>>, and <<punishment,Punishment>>.

[[operator-only]]
==== Operator-Only
Operator-Only transactions are where only the operators have access to the
information required to assemble the transaction with the right input
parameters.

In order to avoid all operators racing to submit the transaction at the same
time, we have an off-chain informal agreement to submit based on the operator's
position in the group (can use the hash of the group's pubkey).

If the designated operator does not submit their transaction before a timeout
expires, the duty moves to the next operator and the group can sign a
transaction to mark that operator as inactive. Since there is no slashing
reward, and since this transaction can only be submitted by an operator, this
transaction is also Operator-Only.

In order to compensate the operator for posting the transaction, the gas spent
will be reimbursed by a DAO-funded eth pool in the same transaction, limited by
`max_gas_refund_price`.

[[public-knowledge]]
==== Public-Knowledge
Public-Knowledge transactions are where anyone has access to the information
required to assemble the transaction.

In order to prevent wasting gas on racing to submit, we can either use an
off-chain informal agreement for the operators like in
<<operator-only,Operator-Only>> transactions, or we can delegate the
transactions to a network like https://www.gelato.network/[Gelato]. We can't
cost-effectively stop members of the public from trying to race to submit.

To compensate these transactions, whoever posts them will have the gas spent
reimbursed by a DAO-funded eth pool in the same transaction, limited by
`max_gas_refund_price`.

[[punishment]]
==== Punishment
Punishment transactions are where anyone has access to the information required
to assemble the transaction (like <<public-knowledge,Public-Knowledge>>) and
the transaction leads to the potential for punishment (reward ineligibility or
slashing).

In these transactions, maintaining system health is more important than
optimizing gas via preventing racing, so we offer up bounties in the form of
potentially slashed tokens to whichever submitter submits first. We do not
compensate gas.

[[meowcoin-sweeping-fee]]
=== Meowcoin Sweeping Fee

Governable Parameters:

- `mewc_fee_broadcast_timeout`: The amount of time an operator has to provide a
  suggested MEWC fee before the other operators give up and try the next
  operator.

Any time a meowcoin transaction needs to be posted and then mined on the meowcoin
blockchain, the miners need to be paid a fee for their work. This fee
fluctuates with market demand and is decently volatile.

The operators need to all agree on a fee before they can construct the sweeping
transaction, but communicating that fee is tricky. When the sortition pool
selects the operators, it selects them in an ordered list. We can leverage this
on-chain order to be the fee-proposal-order. Say that the sortition pool chose
Operators: [#71, #109, #34..., #2]. When it comes time to sweep deposits,
Operator#71 would be expected to query
https://blockstream.info/api/fee-estimates for the 3-block fee and broadcast
this fee to the rest of the operators. If the operators don't receive the fee
from operator #71 before `mewc_fee_broadcast_timeout`, has elapsed, the duty
moves to #109, and then #34, and so on.

*Note*: Each operator may only propose one MEWC fee per sweep (that the other
operators will listen to) or we enable them to spam the communications with fee
proposals until they find one that passes validation.

The operators then validate the fee they received against
https://blockstream.info/api/fee-estimates to make sure that nothing fishy is
going on - that the fee isn't too high or too low (TBD what that means). If it
is, they can wait for `mewc_fee_broadcast_timeout` to elapse and for a new fee
to be proposed.

*Note*: We purposefully leave out on-chain incentives/punishments here. The
attack vector is small and the overhead is high. We might need to revisit this
in the future, but if someone maintained a client fork in order to take
advantage of manipulating mewc fee consensus I would be very surprised.
