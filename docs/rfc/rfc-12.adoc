NOTE: This RFC supersedes link:rfc-7.adoc[RFC 7]

== Background

Currently used wallet coordination mechanism based on the `WalletCoordinator`
smart contract and authorized maintainers turned out to be a single
point of failure of the tMEWC system. This RFC aims to provide
an alternative approach.

=== Current functionality

To execute a wallet action like deposit sweep or redemption, the majority of
signers backing the given tMEWC wallet must attest to it using the threshold
signing process. On a high level, a wallet action execution looks as follows:

1. Signers determine the right input for the signing process (e.g. which deposits
   should be swept, what Meowcoin network fee should be used, and so on).
2. Signers execute the threshold signing process.
3. Signers broadcast outcomes of the signing process (e.g. signed Meowcoin transaction).

The first step is non-trivial as the majority of signers must come into the
same view of the world. An obvious solution for that problem is forcing
signers to use a consensus algorithm and let them agree about the common
state. However, in combination with the ineffective signing algorithm (GG18)
currently used by signers, the consensus-based solution would greatly increase
the time and complexity of the whole signing process. That, in turn, would
negatively impact system stability and user experience.

Moreover, it is worth noting that even with a more effective signing
algorithm (e.g. ROAST), a consensus-based solution will still be a major
challenge. Although effective signing will reduce some overhead, it won't
make the consensus algorithm simpler.

To address the above challenges and make wallet coordination simple,
a contract-based coordination mechanism has been used instead. Their central
point is the `WalletCoordinator` smart contract. This contract is powered
by authorized maintainers and acts as a lighthouse for signers backing tMEWC
wallets. In that model, the wallet coordination mechanism works as follows:

1. Authorized maintainer proposes an action for a specific wallet by submitting
   a transaction to the `WalletCoordinator` contract. The proposal contains
   all the information necessary to build the right input for the threshold
   signing process. Therefore, signers do not need to gather this information on
   their own or reach a consensus about it. For example, a deposit sweep proposal is
   something like: "Wallet A, sweep deposits D1, D2, and D3 using a Meowcoin fee of 10000 sat".
2. Signers of the target wallet receive the proposal. Although maintainers are
   authorized, **they are not trusted**. The received proposal is validated
   by signers to ensure that the proposed action can be executed against the
   current state of the system. For example, in the case of a deposit sweep
   proposal, signers must check whether the deposits proposed for sweep actually
   exist in the system and were not already swept. The validation performed by
   signers depends on the proposal type but often consists of two general steps:
   - On-chain validation. Often done using specialized view functions
     exposed by the `WalletCoordinator` contract
   - Additional validation, such as validation against the state of the Meowcoin chain
3. If the given proposal is invalid, wallet signers ignore it. This is in the
   wallet's best interest, as executing an invalid proposal would not be
   accepted by the system. It would put the wallet into an invalid state and
   make their signers subject to slashing. Conversely, if the proposal is
   deemed valid, wallet signers prepare for execution. First, they ensure that
   any previous actions of the wallet have been completed and that the wallet
   is idle. If not, the proposal is ignored. Second, they prepare all necessary
   data and execute the threshold signing process.

This mechanism takes the consensus burden out of the signers' shoulders and
allows to keep system complexity at a reasonable level during the launch phase.
However, it has some serious drawbacks that become a real pain as the
system grows.

First, specific authorized maintainers are points of failure. If they
go down, wallets stay idle and core actions like deposit sweep or redemptions
halt. This can put the system into an undesired state because:

- All deposits must be either swept (happy path) or refunded to the depositor (unhappy path)
- All redemptions must be either processed (happy path) or timed out (unhappy path)

If core wallet actions do not happen on an ongoing basis, deposit refunds
and redemption timeouts will happen often and harm the system. This is not
acceptable in the long term.

Second, growing the set of authorized maintainers turned out to be a real
challenge. Having a small set of maintainers (or even a single one)
amplifies the aforementioned SPoF problem.

Last but not least, such a design may raise some censorship-related concerns.
Although authorized maintainers are purely a coordination mechanism and
cannot force wallets to do anything against the protocol rules, they can just
become idle on purpose and force refunds on specific deposits or timeouts
on redemptions.

This is why we need to replace the `WalletCoordinator`-based mechanism with
a more robust and decentralized alternative.

== Proposal

Here we propose to replace the global `WalletCoordinator`-based wallet
coordination with an in-wallet mechanism, where each wallet is responsible for
its own coordination.

=== Goal

The goal of this proposal is to eliminate the current naive model, based
on the `WalletCoordinator` contract and authorized maintainers. Pushing the
responsibility of coordination onto wallets should solve the problems of the
current mechanism and make wallet coordination reliable, decentralized,
and censorship-resistant.

=== Implementation

The implementation must meet the proposal goals and be neutral for system
stakeholders as much as possible. Specifically, the implementation:

- Should be possible to introduce in a live system
- Should not have negative impact on key architecture attributes
  (especially security, reliability, maintainability, and performance)
- Should involve only wallet signers and leverage secure broadcast channels
  for inter-signer communication, just as for other wallet actions

As mentioned in the introduction of this RFC, the original consensus-based
solution does not meet the second requirement, as it negatively impacts
reliability and performance. The proposed implementation is something
between the current `WalletCoordinator`-based model and a consensus-based
mechanism. The following sections describe it in detail.

==== Drop the `WalletCoordinator` contract

First and foremost, wallet signers must stop relying on the `WalletCoordinator`
contract. The wallet client software should no longer listen to events emitted
from it and should not trigger any actions as a result.

At this point, it is worth mentioning that the `WalletCoordinator` contract
provides a mechanism of wallet locks, which ensures that an individual wallet
receives only one proposal at a time, and a fixed time delay is preserved
before a subsequent one can be submitted. Getting rid of the `WalletCoordinator`
contract means that the wallet client implementation must handle that problem
on its own. Fortunately, this is already covered in the wallet client
implementation living in the `keep-core` repository. Specifically:

- The `walletDispatcher` component ensures that only one action at a time
is executed by the given wallet
- The `EnsureWalletSyncedBetweenChains` function ensures that previous wallet
actions were properly completed

==== Block-based coordination windows

The proposed mechanism is based on **coordination windows**.

Each coordination window starts with a **coordination block** that occurs
every `coordination_frequency` blocks. To determine if the current block is a
coordination block, signers of individual wallets check:
```
current_block % coordination_frequency == 0
```
If this condition is true, the coordination window begins and signers groups
trigger the **coordination procedure** for their own wallets.

Each coordination window exists for exactly `coordination_duration`
blocks. Once the coordination window's end block is achieved
(`coordination_block + coordination_duration`), the coordination procedure
must either trigger a wallet action or terminate as timed out.

The proposed initial values for:

- `coordination_frequency` is 900 blocks. This corresponds to ~3 hours
  on Ethereum, assuming an average of 12 seconds per block. This is equivalent
  to the redemption schedule existing in the current `WalletCoordinator`-based
  mechanism.
- `coordination_duration` is 100 blocks. This corresponds to ~20 minutes
  on Ethereum, assuming an average of 12 seconds per block. This should be
  enough to execute the coordination procedure along with all necessary network
  communication.

==== Coordination procedure

===== Coordination seed

The coordination procedure starts by determining the **coordination seed**
that will be used for pseudo-random operations executed as part of the
coordination procedure. That seed is computed as:
```
coordination_seed = sha256(wallet_public_key_hash | safe_block_hash)
```

The `wallet_public_key_hash` is the 20-byte public key hash of the wallet
the coordination procedure is executed for.

The `safe_block_hash` is the 32-byte hash of a safe Ethereum block
preceding the coordination block. As the coordination block is always
one of the recent blocks, it is strongly prone to reorganizations, and
its hash can change. Ethereum needs two epochs (64 blocks) to consider a block
as finalized, but only one epoch (32 blocks) to consider a block as safe and
unlikely to be reorged. Therefore, the `safe_block_hash` can be the hash
of block `coordination_block - 32`. The probability that `safe_block_hash`
gets changed due to a chain reorg is negligible. Even if such a deep
reorganization occurs, the impact is limited to a single coordination
window.

===== Coordination leader and followers

After determining the coordination seed, the next step is designating
a **coordination leader**. The idea is similar to the one presented in RFC 7.

The first step is building an ordered list of distinct operators that
control the signers of the given wallet. The ordering algorithm is arbitrary
but must be the same for everyone
(e.g. ascending order by numerical value of the operator address). Even if an
operator controls more than one signer, it appears on the list just once.

For example, if wallets signers are distributed as follows:
```
Signer 1 is controlled by `0xAAA`
Signer 2 is controlled by `0xBBB`
Signer 3 is controlled by `0xAAA`
Signer 4 is controlled by `0xDDD`
Signer 5 is controlled by `0xCCC`
```
The ordered list of distinct operators is `[0xAAA, 0xBBB, 0xCCC, 0xDDD]`
(lexicographic order used as example).

The second step is using the aforementioned coordination seed to build an
instance of the random number generator and use it to shuffle the ordered
distinct operators list:
```
rng = new RNG(coordination_seed)
shuffled_operators = rng.shuffle(ordered_distinct_operators)
```

The first operator from the shuffled list becomes the coordination leader
of the given wallet for the current coordination window. The communication
happens on the signer level so, if the coordination leader controls more than
one signer in the given wallet, it chooses the first (index-wise) signer
to execute the spokesman duties. Signers controlled by non-leader operators
take the role of **coordination followers**.

At this point, it's worth to justify two design decisions made so far:

- Selection is performed on the distinct operators' list and not the signers' list
  to ensure an even distribution of the leader role without favoring operators
  with higher stake and number of signers (seats) in the given wallet. It is
  important to hit different operators being distinct physical nodes as often
  as possible to ensure a high level of fault tolerance and overcome issues
  of individual nodes.
- The block hash is used to form RNG's seed instead of just block number
  in order to make the leader selection as unpredictable as possible.
  Although this is not ideal due to the 32 blocks shift used to find
  the safe block, such a design makes any potential collusion harder. The leader
  is actually known just 32 blocks (~6 min) before the given coordination window
  begins. Relying on just block numbers will make the leader known for all
  coordination windows of the given wallet upfront.

===== Coordination leader's routine

The coordination leader must decide on the wallet action to be executed.
The proposed routine is as follows:

1. Each coordination window, check if redemption action should be executed.
   If so, propose a redemption. Continue otherwise.
2. Every `N` coordination windows, check if deposit sweep or moved funds sweep
   should be executed. If so, propose deposit or moved funds sweep. Continue otherwise.
3. Every `M` coordination windows, check if moving funds should be executed.
   If so, propose moving funds. Continue otherwise.

The `N` and `M` parameters can vary depending on the wallet state.
For example, recent wallets actively looking for deposits can have `N`
lower than old wallets whose main responsibility is redemption. Conversely,
old wallets being at the edge of closure, can use lower `M` to execute
moving funds as quickly as possible. Regardless of the wallet state,
redemptions are always the top priority and occur every window.

If the given leader's routine execution does not lead to an action proposal,
the leader can propose to execute a heartbeat. In order to not execute
heartbeats aggressively, the leader can use the coordination seed and an RNG
to draw a decision with a specific `heartbeat_probability` of success.
Using a `heartbeat_probability` of 12.5% seems to be reasonable assuming
`coordination_frequency` is 900 blocks. That means a completely idle wallet
will perform a heartbeat every 4 coordination windows on average
(or 8 in the worst case) so, every 3600 blocks
(~12 hours assuming 12 seconds per Ethereum block). The `wallet_public_key_hash`
factor used to build the coordination seed should help avoid multiple wallets
doing the heartbeat at the same time. Without that, all wallets would use
the same coordination seed for the given coordination window.

If heartbeat proposal is also not the case, the leader should send
a **confirmation of activity**.

To summarize, the pseudocode of the coordination leader routine is as follows:
```
if current_block % coordination_frequency == 0
    propose_redemption_or_continue()

    if current_block % (coordination_frequency * N) == 0
        propose_deposit_sweep_or_continue()
        propose_moved_funds_sweep_or_continue()

    if current_block % (coordination_frequency * M) == 0
        propose_moving_funds_or_continue()

    rng = new RNG(coordination_seed)
    if rng.get_bool_with_probability(12.5)
        propose_heartbeat()

    conirm_activity()
```

The coordination leader's routine can be implemented in the wallet client
using the existing Go code living in the `pkg/maintainer/wallet` package
of the `keep-core` repository.

===== Communication

Once the coordination leader completes the routine, it uses a dedicated
secure broadcast channel to communicate the decision to the followers.
It creates a **coordination message** and signs it using the operator's
private key. A coordination message should look as follows:
```
CoordinationMessage
    int member_id                // first signer controlled by the coordination leader
    int coordination_block       // start block for the current coordination window
    bytes wallet_public_key_hash // 20-byte public key hash of the wallet
    bytes proposal               // serialized proposal; empty if this is just activity confirmation
```

Each signer-follower should start listening for an incoming coordination
message upon the start of the coordination window and should continue to do
so for 80% of the window's duration. The remaining 20% of the window's
duration should be a buffer allowing for the validation of the received message
and preparation for action execution. No coordination message should be
accepted during that time. The 80/20 ratio is an initial proposition and
can be adjusted if needed.

If a coordination message lands on time, the receiver should:

- Make sure the given coordination message actually comes from the current
  coordination leader. This can be done by knowing the coordination block,
  coordinated wallet, and the coordination message's signature
- Schedule the proposed wallet action to be executed at the coordination
  window's end block. All necessary wallet state and proposal validation should
  be done at the beginning of this action as a prerequisite of the threshold
  signing process

If the coordination message does not come from the current coordination leader,
it should be ignored and its sender should be stored in the **coordination
faults** cache.

If the coordination message comes from the current coordination leader but
carries an invalid proposal, it should be ignored and the current coordination
leader should be stored in the **coordination faults** cache.

If the coordination message does not come at all, the coordination window
ends without any action. The current coordination leader who missed its turn
should be stored in the **coordination faults** cache.

==== Introduce the `WalletProposalValidator` contract

As stated before, the `WalletCoordinator` contract will no longer be used.
However, this contract exposes some useful readonly view functions that allow the
wallet client software to perform an on-chain validation of the incoming
proposals. Those functions are:

- `validateDepositSweepProposal`
- `validateRedemptionProposal`

Both are currently used by the wallet client implementation
living in the `keep-core` repository.

Those readonly functions are beneficial because:

- On-chain validation rules are transparent and not dependent on
  specific wallet client implementations
- This is a multi-call pattern ensuring all data used to execute the validation
  come from the same block. This reduces the complexity of the wallet client.
- On-chain validation can be done using a single RPC call. This reduces the
  infrastructure costs of the wallet client.

Therefore, we propose extracting the aforementioned view functions to
a new, **entirely readonly** `WalletProposalValidator` smart contract.
**This contract will be non-upgradeable and will not have any write functions**.
If there is a need to change the on-chain validation rules of wallet proposals
(e.g. maximum count of deposits swept at once), a new instance of
the `WalletProposalValidator` contract should be deployed. Wallet operators
would have to agree to use the new contract instance by doing an upgrade of
their wallet client software.

=== Limitations

The presented implementation has some limitations:

- Although the presented mechanism should not have a significant impact on performance
  in current circumstances, increased network traffic and CPU consumption may
  emerge once the number of live wallets goes up significantly. However,
  this should no longer be a problem once the wallet client implementation
  supports moving funds and uses a faster signing algorithm (e.g. ROAST).
  The new coordination mechanism can also be fine-tuned to some extent.
- The presented mechanism is not immune to coordination leader idleness.
  Misbehavior and inactivity are supposed to be recorded in the coordination
  faults cache but, discouraging such behavior is beyond the scope of the
  presented implementation. See the link:#_future_work[Future work] section for
  possible solutions.
- The presented mechanism provides poor observability. The currently
  used `WalletCoordinator`-based mechanism captures the whole proposal history
  on-chain. This is no longer the case for the new mechanism. Potential
  debugging will be much harder. A possible solution is capturing
  an internal proposal history in the wallet client and optionally exposing it
  through the diagnostics endpoint. Exposing the coordination faults cache
  may be also helpful. Individual wallet operators may decide whether to expose
  the history or not.

== Future work

There is some related future work not explored by this RFC:

- Consequences of failed wallet heartbeats. A failed heartbeat should cause
  a punishment of inactive signers (rewards ineligibility) and/or start
  the moving funds process for the given wallet. This can be done using
  the `notifyOperatorInactivity` function exposed by the `WalletRegistry`
  contract.
- Consequences of coordination faults. Misbehavior/inactivity of coordination
  leaders should be discouraged. How to achieve that is an open question.
  A possible solution is making them ineligible for rewards. An alternative
  idea is not punishing for inactivity but designating a reserve coordination
  leader that would take the leader's duties for the given coordination window
  if needed.
- Decentralized SPV proof submission. Nowadays, this is handled by authorized
  maintainers as well. There may be a need to either extend the maintainer set or
  make SPV proof submission a responsibility of the wallet signers.
