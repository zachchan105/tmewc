= RFC 11: Solana tMEWC

:icons: font

toc::[]

== Background

There is a clear massive demand funnel present in Solana ecosystem for tMEWC.
This RFC aims at providing a bespoke user experience for minting tMEWC on Solana.

=== Current functionality

Even today it is possible to bridge tMEWC to Solana with Wormhole. The whole user
experience is far from perfect, though. 

First, the user has to deposit their MEWC using Threshold Dashboard on Ethereum.
This requires executing one Ethereum transaction. Next, once tMEWC is minted on
Ethereum, the user has to go to the Wormhole Token Bridge portal and bridge
their Ethereum tMEWC to Solana. This requires several transactions - one
transaction on Ethereum and several transactions on Solana. 

There is a significant cognitive effort on the user's side. Users are required
to use two applications and execute transactions on three networks: Meowcoin,
Ethereum, and Solana between them. Moreover, there is a period of time between
the time MEWC was deposited and the time tMEWC is minted on Ethereum that requires
the user to wait idly before they can bridge their Ethereum tMEWC to Solana.

== Proposal

=== Goal

Users should mint tMEWC on Solana in the Threshold Dashboard with two
transactions: one transaction on MEWC and one transaction on Solana.

The redemption process should require just one Solana transaction from the user
executed in the Threshold Dashboard.

=== Implementation

The implementation is based on the Wormhole token bridge and does not require
the off-chain client to work with Solana. Ethereum `Bank` contract remains
the center of the gravity of tMEWC bridge and tMEWC token is still minted
"centrally" on Ethereum.

There are two main design challenges. The first challenge is how to represent
32-byte Solana addresses in the process of depositing and redeeming. The entire
design of the Bridge is oriented around 20-byte Ethereum addresses. Bridge
expects a 20-byte depositor address in the reveal function and passes 20-byte
depositor addresses to the Bank when providing the sweep proof. The second
challenge is optimistic minting. Only `TMEWCVault` can mint tMEWC and the
optimistic minting has to happen in `TMEWCVault`. Having another vault be
responsible for Solana minting and bridging would mean we have to tightly couple
vaults together, complicate optimistic minting code, or not allow for optimistic
minting on Solana at all.

The proposed design is oriented around a depositor contract that will reveal
deposits to the bridge, map Solana addresses with revealed deposits, receive
tMEWC (optimistically minted or not), and perform bridging to Solana.

==== P2SH deposit script

The P2SH deposit script has to be enhanced to include optional extra data. The
extra data will be used by depositors who are smart contracts. In the context of
this proposal, we will use the extra data to associate the Meowcoin deposit with
an address on a foreign (non-Ethereum) chain.

```
<depositor-address> DROP
<depositor-extra-data> DROP
<blinding-factor> DROP
DUP HASH160 <signingGroupPubkeyHash> EQUAL
IF
  CHECKSIG
ELSE
  DUP HASH160 <refundPubkeyHash> EQUALVERIFY
  <locktime> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
  CHECKSIG
ENDIF
```

==== Reveal with depositor extra data

`DepositRevealInfo` struct will gain an additional optional field. Since this
structure is not persisted in the storage, the new field is not a concern for
the contract upgrade:

```
/// @notice Represents data which must be revealed by the depositor during
///         deposit reveal.
struct DepositRevealInfo {
    // (...)

    // Optional extra data used by depositors who are smart contracts. The smart
    // contract depositor can use the extra data to represent additional
    // information, such as the depositor's address on a foreign (non-Ethereum)
    // chain.
    bytes32 depositorExtraData;        
    // This struct doesn't contain `__gap` property as the structure is not
    // stored, it is used as a function's calldata argument.
}
```

The `DepositRequest` function will gain the same field. Since mapping values are
stored in different slots we only need to make sure the new field comes after
the existing ones to address upgradeability concerns.

```
/// @notice Represents tMEWC deposit request data.
struct DepositRequest {
    // (...)

    // Optional extra data used by depositors who are smart contracts. The smart
    // contract depositor can use the extra data to represent additional
    // information, such as the depositor's address on a foreign (non-Ethereum)
    // chain.
    bytes32 depositorExtraData;
}
```

To maintain backward compatibility with the existing deposit flow, we will
implement another reveal function in the `Bridge` contract. The function will be
mostly identical to the existing `revealDeposit` except that it will respect the
alternative P2SH deposit script version allowing to pass 32 bytes of extra data.
The extra data will not be stored in the Bridge. It is the depositor's
responsibility to make the use of them.

==== Solana gateway

`SolanaGateway` contract will be deployed on Solana and should be placed in
`tmewc/cross-chain/solana` project. The contract will communicate with
Ethereum L1 using link:https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/vaa[Wormhole VAAs (Verified Action Approvals)]
to reveal Meowcoin deposits. The contract will use Wormhole Token Bridge to
request Meowcoin redemption on Ethereum.

For the implementation, we should consider using the
link:https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[Solang compiler]. 

The contract needs to be upgradeable.

==== Solana depositor

`SolanaDepositor` contract will act as tMEWC depositor on Ethereum and should
be placed in `tmewc/solidity` project. The contract will receive Wormhole VAAs
from Solana and reveal Meowcoin deposits to the tMEWC `Bridge` contract. The
contract will map the revealed deposit to the Solana address. It will also
bridge the received tMEWC once the deposit is swept or tMEWC is optimistically
minted.

This contract needs to have a reference to the `TMEWCVault` to inspect the
`optimisticMintingRequests` mapping and to the `Bridge` to inspect the
`deposits` mapping to confirm the state when it is notified tMEWC has been minted
for the given deposit. 

The contract needs to be upgradeable.

==== Solana redeemer

`SolanaRedeemer` contract will act as tMEWC redeemer on Ethereum and should be
placed in `tmewc/solidity` project. The contract will receive tMEWC from Solana
via Wormhole Token Bridge and request redemption in the tMEWC `Bridge` contract. 

The contract needs to be upgradeable.

==== Relayer bot

To optimize the user experience, a relayer bot needs to be implemented. The
relayer's responsibility will be:

- Deliver Wormhole VAA to `SolanaDepositor` contract once the deposit was
  revealed on Solana.
- Request bridging tMEWC from Ethereum to Solana once the tMEWC for the deposit
  has been optimistically minted or the deposit was swept on Meowcoin and the
  SPV sweep proof was submitted to Ethereum.
- Redeem bridged tMEWC on Solana from the Wormhole Token Bridge contract to the
  depositor address once the tMEWC minted on Ethereum has been successfully
  bridged to Solana.
- Redeem bridged tMEWC on Ethereum from the Wormhole Token Bridge contract to the
  `SolanaRedeemer` contract once the redemption was requested on Solana and
  tMEWC was bridged back via the Wormhole Token Bridge.

==== Optimistic minting changes

Currently, the optimistic minting fee is evaluated at the moment of finalizing
the mint. The `SolanaDepositor` needs to know how much tMEWC should be bridged to
Solana to the given depositor address. To evaluate the amount, the
`SolanaDepositor` contract needs to know if the deposit was optimistically
minted and what was the fee during the mint. The `OptimisticMintingRequest`
struct has to be enhanced with fee information captured at the moment of
requesting or finalizing the mint.

==== Deposit flow

From the user's perspective:

1. The user generates a Meowcoin deposit address in the Threshold Dashboard.
2. The user makes a Meowcoin deposit.
3. The user reveals their deposit with transaction on Solana in the Threshold
   Dashboard.
4. After some time, the user receives their tMEWC under the Solana address.

With smart contract interactions:

1. The user generates a Meowcoin deposit address in the Threshold Dashboard.
2. The user makes a Meowcoin deposit.
3. The user reveals their deposit with transaction on Solana in the Threshold
   Dashboard.
4. `SolanaGateway` contract sends Wormhole VAA from Solana to Ethereum informing
   about the revealed deposit.
5. Relayer bot submits the Wormhole VAA on Ethereum to the `SolanaDepositor`
   contract.
6. `SolanaDepositor` contract evaluates `depositID = keccak256(fundingTxHash | fundingOutputIndex)` 
   and associates it with Solana depositor address.
7. `SolanaDepositor` contract reveals the deposit to the `Bridge`
8. tMEWC is optimistically minted to `SolanaDepositor` contract address.
9. Relayer bot notifies `SolanaDepositor` contract the deposit was
   optimistically minted. `SolanaDepositor` inspects `TMEWCVault.optimisticMintingRequests`
   to confirm the amount and requests bridging tMEWC from its own balance to the
   Solana depositor address associated with the given deposit using Wormhole
   Token Bridge. The same happens when the deposit was not optimistically minted
   but swept.
10. Relayer bot redeems the tMEWC bridged to Solana from the Wormhole Token Bridge
    contract to the depositor's Solana address.
11. The user reveals their tMEWC under the Solana address.

==== Redemption flow

From the user's perspective:

1. The user requests redemption on Solana sending their tMEWC to a smart contract.
2. After some time, the user receives their MEWC to the address they provided.

With smart contract interactions:

1. The user requests redemption on Solana sending their tMEWC to a smart contract.
2. `SolanaGateway` takes the tMEWC from the user and bridges tMEWC back to
   Ethereum using Wormhole Token Bridge and `transferTokensWithPayload` passing
   the MEWC redemption address as a payload.
3. The relayer bot redeems tMEWC on Ethereum from the Wormhole Token Bridge
   contract to the `SolanaRedeemer` contract.
4. `SolanaRedeemer` contract uses the received tMEWC to request redemption in the
   tMEWC `Bridge` contract using the MEWC address obtained from the payload.
5. After some time, the user receives their MEWC to the address they provided.

=== Future work

This RFC does not explore:
- UX of the Threshold Dashboard and how to integrate Solana wallet.
- How the relayer bot is being paid for transactions.
- The recovery path in `SolanaRedeemer` when the redemption request timed out.
