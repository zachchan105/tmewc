= RFC 4: Using the Random Beacon

== Overview

The Random Beacon provides high-quality randomness
which is important for secure group selection.

When the Random Beacon produces an entry,
we should use that entry immediately
so that operators don't have too much of an opportunity
to manipulate sortition pool state.
Additionally,
the beacon may be busy and unable to produce an entry at a given time.

To deal with these requirements,
we can perform group selection as follows:

=== Phase 1: entry generation

Alice determines that the _maintenance reward_ for wallet creation
has grown large enough to be worth paying the cost of performing it.
The maintenance reward pool must have at least the amount of T tokens
required to pay the random beacon for a new entry.
Remaining T tokens after the entry payment
will be used as the basis for determining the maintenance reward.

She submits a transaction calling `requestNewEntry()`,
which calls the random beacon asking for a new entry,
passing on the appropriate payment in T tokens,
and specifying the callback for the random beacon.
If the beacon is available,
Alice is recorded as the `currentEntryRequester`
and `requestNewEntry()` is blocked from being called
until `currentEntryRequester` is cleared.

We can also freeze the sortition pool at this point,
preventing any changes to the pool until a sortition is performed.
Because the new entry is not known by anyone at this point,
freezing the sortition pool prevents most forms of manipulation
to influence the composition of the resulting group.
Because joining and leaving the pool is prevented,
the only remaining avenue for influencing the sortition
is to make an operator that would be selected be ineligible
and thus shift the distribution of subsequently selected operators.

If the beacon is busy,
or the provided payment is insufficient,
the transaction reverts.

=== Phase 2: using the entry for sortition

Once the random beacon has generated an entry,
it calls `submitEntry(newEntry)` to store the entry as `currentSortitionSeed`.

After the sortition seed is set,
the sortition outcome can be determined
by calling a view function on the sortition pool.
The operators should check the outcome off-chain 
and form the resulting group and perform DKG.

After DKG has been performed,
a member of the formed group can call `submitDkgResult()` on tMEWC.
If the DKG result has been signed by at least `threshold + 1` members,
the contract will accept the DKG result submission.
This begins a challenge period of 100 blocks,
during which anyone can report a discrepancy in the wallet members.
If someone reports a discrepancy,
tMEWC can check the actual sortition outcome from the sortition pool.
If the discrepancy is real,
all operators who signed the incorrect group member list will be penalised
and the fraudulent wallet is destroyed.
The real group should now submit their DKG result.

After the challenge period is over,
the result can be confirmed in a transaction
which also pays the appropriate reward to Alice,
and clears `currentSortitionSeed`, `currentEntryRequester`,
and unlocks the sortition pool.

If the DKG timeout is reached without a valid result being submitted,
the timeout can be reported.
No wallet is created,
but the sortition seed is discarded,
the current entry requester is rewarded and cleared,
and the sortition pool is unlocked.
