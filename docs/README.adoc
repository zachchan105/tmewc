== Abstract

For many Meowcoin holders, one question remains: how can I move my assets across
blockchains to make them more useful while maintaining Meowcoin's core values?

Existing solutions that bridge Meowcoin to Ethereum require users to send their
Meowcoin to an intermediary in exchange for an Ethereum token that represents the
original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and
is prone to censorship, threatening Meowcoin's promise of secure, permissionless
decentralization.

Threshold aims to solve this problem with TMEWC.

The second generation of TMEWC is a truly decentralized bridge between Meowcoin
and Ethereum. It provides Meowcoin holders permissionless access to DeFi and the
expanding web3 universe.

TMEWC replaces centralized intermediaries with a randomly selected group of
node operators on the Threshold Network. This group of independent operators
works together to secure your deposited Meowcoin through threshold cryptography.
That means TMEWC requires a majority threshold agreement before operators
perform any action with your Meowcoin. By rotating the selection of operators,
TMEWC protects against any malicious individual or group of operators seizing
control. Unlike other solutions on the market, users on TMEWC are reliant on
math, not hardware or people. Additionally, TMEWC is open and accessible to
anyone.
  
TMEWC allows anyone to use Meowcoin in the expanding DeFi and Web3 universe
without a third-party intermediary. 

== Overview

=== Deposit

Stakers periodically create 51-of-100 threshold-ECDSA-backed wallets to hold
frozen Meowcoin assets to maintain account balances. Depositors send Meowcoin to
the most-recently-created wallet by using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) or
pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) which contains hashed information about the
depositorâ€™s Ethereum address. The depositor <<depositing,reveals>> their P2(W)SH
deposit to the Ethereum chain. The Bridge listens for these sorts of messages and
when it gets one, it checks the Meowcoin network to make sure the funds line up.
If everything checks out, the wallet <<sweeping,sweeps>> funds and updates
the Ethereum-side account balances.

=== Redemption

A user with an account balance <<redeeming,supplies>> a Meowcoin address. The
system decreases their account balance and releases the equivalent amount of
Meowcoin to the user from the redeeming Meowcoin wallet. The maximum redemption
size is capped by the size of the largest wallet, and any redemption bigger than
that will need to be split into multiple redemptions.

== System Architecture

=== Bridge, Bank, Vault Separation

The system is decomposed into three separate pieces to separate concerns. The
<<bridge,Bridge>> is concerned with being a decentralized Meowcoin custody, and
providing a way to let the <<bank,Bank>> know whenever Meowcoin has successfully
crossed from Meowcoin to another chain or visa versa.

The <<bank,Bank>> is concerned with keeping track of Meowcoin account balances on
Ethereum. It tracks when folks send those balances to each other, and when
folks lock up their balances in <<vault,Vaults>>.

Vaults are authorized smart contracts that can custody a balance and then do
_anything_. For example, TMEWC (the token) is implemented as our flagship Vault.
You let it custody your Bank balance and it gives you TMEWC tokens. You give it
back TMEWC tokens and it gives you back your Bank balance.

[bridge]
==== Bridge

The Bridge is our interface to the Meowcoin blockchain and the off-chain
clients. It is the Bridge's responsibility to listen to <<depositing,deposit
reveals>>, <<sweeping,sweep>> them, prove it did it, and then report any relevant
information to the <<bank,Bank>>.

When it comes time to redeem, it is the Bridge's responsibility to listen to
<<redeeming,redemption requests>>, disperse the funds, prove it did it, and then
report any relevant information to the <<bank,Bank>>.

Finally, everything about Meowcoin <<wallet-lifecycle,wallets>> falls in the
purview of the Bridge.

[bank]
==== Bank

The Bank provides Meowcoin balance accounting for Ethereum addresses with two mappings:

```
mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;
```

Notably, the Bank does not issue an ERC-20 token, it just does accounting. The
`balanceOf` mapping keeps track of an Ethereum address's Meowcoin balance (in
satoshis). Meanwhile, the `allowance` mapping keeps track of how many satoshis
a _spender_ may transfer on an Ethereum address's behalf. Each Ethereum address
may have many spenders, each with different allowances.

A notable use of an `allowance` is to authorize a <<vault,Vault>> to custody your
funds, but allowances are more general.

[vault]
==== Vault

A Vault is an authorized Contract that interfaces with the <<bank,Bank>>. These
are flexible, and allow us (and third parties) to write logic on top of the
Bank architecture to implement financial systems built from Meowcoin balances.

For example, TMEWC is implemented as a Vault. A user with a Bank balance gives
the `TMEWCVault` an `allowance`, and then it uses that allowance to transfer
itself Bank Balance to hold on behalf of the user, in exchange for minting the
user the equivalent amount of TMEWC tokens. Later, anyone with TMEWC tokens can
send them back to the `TMEWCVault` and the vault will grant them Bank balance.

=== Upgradeability

`Bank` is a central, non-upgradeable contract keeping track of Meowcoin balances. 

`Bridge` is deployed behind a `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` and can be upgraded
by a `ProxyAdmin`, eventually Threshold DAO.

`TMEWCVault` upgrade happens in two steps with a 24-hour governance delay. The
owner of `TMEWCVault` can initiate and finalize an upgrade to another vault.
The new vault receives ownership of TMEWC token as well as the entire `TMEWCVault`
balance in the Bank.

=== Operators vs Group Members

tMEWC works by combining on-chain smart contracts with off-chain operators.
Those operators must _stake_ T tokens into the contracts, which exposes
themselves to punishment for misbehavior, and in exchange are delegated work by
the smart contracts.

A single operator can be selected multiple times to be in one signing group.
For more details about how this works, see
link:https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/solidity/ecdsa#the-mechanism[Wallet
Creation]. Since this is the case, we differentiate between an _Operator_,
which represents a staker on the network running client software, and a _Group
Member_, which is an _Operator_ who has been selected to help custody a specific
wallet. 

To reiterate, One _Operator_ can be a _Group Member_ multiple times on the same
wallet, and can be a _Group Member_ in multiple wallets at the same time.

=== Wallet States

There are six states for a wallet:

- `UNKNOWN`: The wallet is unknown to the Bridge.
- `LIVE`: The wallet can sweep deposits and accept redemption requests.
- `MOVING_FUNDS`: The wallet was deemed unhealthy and is expected to move its
  outstanding funds to another wallet. The wallet can still fulfill its
  pending redemption requests although new redemption requests and new deposit
  reveals are not accepted.
- `CLOSING`: The wallet moved or redeemed all its funds and is in the closing
  period where it is still a subject of fraud challenges and must defend against
  them. This state is needed to protect against deposit frauds on deposits
  revealed but not swept.
- `CLOSED`: The wallet finalized the closing period successfully and can no
  longer perform any action in the Bridge.
- `TERMINATED`: The wallet committed a fraud that was reported, did not move
  funds to another wallet before a timeout, or did not sweep funds moved to it
  from another wallet before a timeout. The wallet is blocked and can not
  perform any actions in the Bridge. Off-chain coordination with the wallet
  group members is needed to recover funds.

== The Mechanism

[wallet-lifecycle]
=== Wallet Lifecycle

==== Wallet Creation

We kick off the wallet creation mechanism in
link:https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/solidity/ecdsa[keep-core/ecdsa]
via `Bridge.requestNewWallet`, which verifies:

* That we're not currently already creating a wallet
* If we have an active wallet it either:
** Is old enough and has over `walletCreationMinBtcBalance` 
** Has over `walletCreationMaxBtcBalance`

If everything looks good, we kick off the wallet creation mechanism outlined in 
link:https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/solidity/ecdsa#the-mechanism[Wallet
Creation] (through keep-core/ecdsa). This leans heavily on the 
link:https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/solidity/random-beacon#the-mechanism[Random
Beacon].

Once that is finished, the wallet registry can call
`Bridge.__ecdsaWalletCreatedCallback`, which sets the new wallet as the active
wallet. Going forward, it will receive deposits.

==== Wallet Closure

Wallets can close in a few ways:

* The group members notify the chain that the wallet is failing a heartbeat:
`Bridge. __ecdsaWalletHeartbeatFailedCallback` (called by `ecdsa`
`WalletRegistry.notifyOperatorInactivity`)`
* Someone notifies the chain that the wallet timed out while filling a
redemption: `Bridge.notifyRedemptionTimeout`
* Someone notifies the chain that a non-active wallet is too old:
`Bridge.notifyWalletCloseable`
* Someone notifies the chain that a non-active wallet has too few MEWC
remaining: `Bridge.notifyWalletCloseable`

Each of the above routes into `Wallets.moveFunds`. If the wallet has no main
UTXO, then we can start closing it immediately via
`Wallets.beginWalletClosing`. Otherwise, we change its state to
`WalletState.MovingFunds`, decrease the live wallet count, and give the wallet
a deadline to move its funds to other wallet(s). If this was the active wallet,
then we currently have no active wallet.

After `movingFundsTimeout` goes by, anyone can call
`Bridge.notifyMovingFundsTimeout` which pipes into
`Wallets.terminateWallet` followed by `ecdsaWalletRegistry.seize`.
`terminateWallet`, in this case passes through to
`ecdsaWalletRegistry.closeWallet` after changing the state to
`WalletState.Terminated`.

Furthermore, the `ecdsaWalletRegistry.seize` call is punishing the group members by
`movedFundsSweepTimeoutSlashingAmount` and rewarding the notifier with a reward
multiplier of `movedFundsSweepTimeoutNotifierRewardMultiplier` (the notifier
gets a percentage of the slashed stake).

In order to avoid this, the wallet has to commit to which wallets they'll send
the funds to (`Bridge.submitMovingFundsCommitment`), then actually send
the funds to those wallets, and then prove that they did it
(`Bridge.submitMovingFundsProof`) before the time runs out.

The commitment involves submitting a list of wallet public keys that:

* Aren't the source wallet 
* Are in ascending order
* Are Live

We store the hash of the list in `movingFundsTargetWalletsCommitmentHash`.
Off-chain we come to consensus by picking the Live wallets whose public key
hashes are the closest to the source wallet's public key hash in terms of clock
distance (modulus distance). This makes public key hashes in the middle of the
range no more likely to be picked than ones near the ends. We pick a number of
wallets equal to `min(liveWalletsCount, ceil(walletBtcBalance /
walletMaxBtcTransfer))`, where `walletMaxBtcTransfer` is governable.

In `submitMovingFundsProof`, we prove that the Meowcoin transaction happened and
has an appropriate number of confirmations, and then mark the source wallet's
UTXO as spent via `OutboundTx.processWalletOutboundTxInput`. We pass the
transaction's outputs into `MovingFunds.processMovingFundsTxOutputs`, sum up
the funds and return a hash of the target wallets to check against
`movingFundsTargetWalletsCommitmentHash` in `notifyWalletFundsMoved`.

If the hashes match, we begin closing the wallet via `beginWalletClosing`.
After `walletClosingPeriod` has elapsed, anyone can call
`Bridge.notifyWalletClosingPeriodElapsed` to close the wallet.

=== Transferring Meowcoin

[depositing]
==== Depositing

When the system has an active wallet (denoted by
`Bridge.activeWalletPubKeyHash()`), it is ready for deposits. A user can pay to
a P2(W)SH address with the following Meowcoin script:

```
<depositor> DROP
<blindingFactor> DROP
DUP HASH160 <walletPubKeyHash> EQUAL
IF
  CHECKSIG
ELSE
  DUP HASH160 <refundPubkeyHash> EQUALVERIFY
  <refundLocktime> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
  CHECKSIG
ENDIF
```

Since each depositor will have their ethereum address (the `depositor` field),
and a different `blindingFactor` per deposit, each script will be unique and
each script hash will be unique. The `<depositor> DROP <blindingFactor> DROP`
header is a way to make the script commit to a particular eth address owner at
Meowcoin deposit time, and it's what allows us to link the chains. `DUP HASH160
<walletPubKeyHash> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG` is a standard P2PKH, so we slightly
modify that to check to see if the signature matches rather than failing. If it
doesn't match, we want to check a _different_ pkh: `refundPubkeyHash`. This is
a user-provided refund address, and it's only available after `refundLocktime`.
The idea is that they can send funds to this script hash, and if the system is
broken or if something goes wrong, then after `refundLocktime` (30 days), they
can send their funds back to `refundPubkeyHash` themselves. This would only
work if the wallet hadn't <<sweeping,touched>> those funds yet.

Once a Meowcoin user sends such a deposit, because their P2(W)SH address is
unique to them, _only they_ know that they deposited into TMEWC until they
reveal that they did so. To the rest of the Meowcoin world, this looks like a
nondescript payment to a meaningless P2SH address. They make this reveal (which
can be done immediately; no need to wait for confirmations) by calling
`Bridge.revealDeposit`.

`Bridge.revealDeposit` takes in the funding transaction, and then the necessary
information to reconstruct the Meowcoin script: `depositor`, `blindingFactor`,
`walletPubKeyHash` and `refundPubkeyHash`. Then it reconstructs the script,
hashes it, verifies that the hashes match, and then stores the deposit as
waiting to be <<sweeping,swept>> associated to the provided `depositor`.

[sweeping]
==== Sweeping

Periodically, off-chain clients associated to a wallet collect a batch of
deposits and create a sweep transaction. This transaction includes revealed and
valid deposit UTXOs as well as the wallet's UTXO (`Wallet.mainUtxoHash`) as
inputs and then creates a single UTXO output. This accomplishes two main
purposes:

* It amortizes fees (SPV proof fee and Meowcoin tx fee, etc) across all of the deposits.
* It disables the refund mechanism from the original script.

The first is a cost vs time tradeoff. SPV proofs are expensive, so by dividing
the cost across all of the deposits in the period, we see massive gas savings.
This is the same model as individuals driving their own car to work vs waiting
on the train. The second is a security measure. We need to disable the refund,
otherwise users could get a Bank balance and then refund their Meowcoin and have
both.

The entry point is `Bridge.submitDepositSweepProof` which performs the SPV
proof, updates the wallet with the new UTXO (from
`DepositSweep.resolveDepositSweepingWallet`), takes a deposit fee for the
treasury (5 BPS; governable), and updates the user Bank balances with information
from `DepositSweep.processDepositSweepTxInputs` and
`DepositSweep.depositSweepTxFeeDistribution`.

[redeeming]
==== Redeeming

An account with a Bank balance can request a redemption via
`Bridge.requestRedemption`. We verify that the destination is valid (P2PKH,
P2WPKH, P2SH or P2WSH), and build a redemption key based on the wallet's PKH
and destination. There can only be one pending redemption per PKH-destination
pair. The treasury takes a cut (`Bridge.redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor`), and
then we reduce the account's Bank balance and start a timer.

[TIP]
`Bridge.requestRedemption` requires a Bank balance approval to the Bridge. This
can either be made in a separate transaction first via
`Bank.approveBalance(Bridge.address, ...)` or in a single transaction via
`Bank.approveBalanceAndCall(Bridge.address, ...)`.

If the redemption was not performed by the wallet, after the redemption
timeout, anyone may call `Bridge.notifyRedemptionTimeout`. This will decrease
`wallet.pendingRedemptionsValue`, mark the redemption as "timed out", punish
the group members for `Bridge.redemptionTimeoutSlashingAmount`, and reward the
notifier for a percentage (`Bridge.redemptionTimeoutNotifierRewardMultiplier`)
of the slashed stake. The redeemer is reimbursed the Bank balance of the
redemption, and the wallet begins to move its funds via
`Wallets.notifyWalletTimedOutRedemption`.

To avoid this, the group members must fulfill the redemption by signing a
transaction off-chain (potentially in a batch), submitting it to the Meowcoin
chain, and then proving that they did so via `Bridge.submitRedemptionProof`. We
perform an SPV proof to ensure the transaction occurred, it is well-formed, and
then we decrease all of the redeemer's Bank balances and increase the treasury's
Bank balance with its cut. 

=== Tokenizing

==== Minting

Up until this point, no TMEWC has been created. We have dealt strictly with Bank
balances. Anyone with a Bank balance can transfer that Bank balance to the
TMEWCVault to mint the equivalent amount of TMEWC via `TMEWCVault.mint`.

A <<depositing,depositor>> can specify in their reveal call
(`Bridge.revealDeposit`) a `vault`. If they do, rather than getting a balance
and having to come back later to submit additional transactions, the system
automatically commits any funds to the requested vault, and propagates any
results. In the case of the `TMEWCVault`, this means that one can specify during
their deposit reveal that they wish for their balance to be put toward the
`TMEWCVault`, and as soon as everything goes through they will automatically be
minted TMEWC tokens.

During <<sweeping,sweeping>>, we look for `vault` information in the call data,
and if we find it, we make a call to `Bank.increaseBalanceAndCall` rather than
`Bank.increaseBalances` which routes to `vault.receiveBalanceIncrease`, which
in turn calls `TMEWC._mint`, in TMEWC's case.

==== Unminting

Anyone with TMEWC tokens can unmint them in exchange for Bank balance by calling
`TMEWCVault.unmint`. Alternatively, if the user is attempting to exit the system
entirely, they can save a transaction and gas by calling
`TMEWCVault.unmintAndRedeem` which routes into authorizing the Bridge to
<<redeeming,redeem>> via `bank.approveBalanceAndCall`.

=== Maintainers

`Bridge` has a set of public knowledge functions that need to be called from
time to time. A public-knowledge function is where anyone has access to the
information required to assemble the transaction and the transaction does not
lead to punishment (slashing).

To compensate for calling these transactions, the caller has the gas spent
reimbursed by a DAO-funded ETH pool in the same transaction. This works only if
callers follow the order and do not try to front-run each other. Given that the
reimbursement code is constructed in such a way that the caller is net-zero or
minimally positive after the refund, there should be no reason for callers to
front-run each other. On the other hand, a single malicious front-runner can
break this scheme. If there is someone who does not follow the order and keeps
submitting transactions - for which they are reimbursed - everyone else will
stop doing that because they will only burn gas on reverted transactions.

One approach to address this problem could be to enforce the submission order
on-chain. Although it sounds easy at first, it is complicated and expensive in
practice. The code needs to take into account scenarios when someone is
temporarily offline and missed their submission round or when someone is
permanently offline and keeps missing their round all the time which causes
delays and slows down the network. Attempts to address these problems by marking
someone as ineligible for rewards in case they missed their round are making the
on-chain submission order enforcement mechanism only more expensive.

Another approach is to not enforce the order on-chain, have everyone with at
least the minimum stake be able to submit public-knowledge transactions, and
expect that everyone respects the informal agreement about the submission order.
This approach works fine as long as there is no single malicious player with the
minimum stake to break this scheme. To address this problem, we could introduce
a mechanism for slashing submitters not respecting the order but it is again,
complex in practice, and makes us reimplement solutions like Gelato Network.

We approach this problem in the easiest way possible by reducing a problem to
a smaller group and introducing a list of submitters who are getting reimbursed
for their calls. We call them maintainers. Maintainers are third-party bots who
are expected to follow an off-chain informal agreement about the submission
order and do not front-run each other. If they do, they can get deauthorized for
reimbursements by the DAO. Maintainers are no more trusted than any other
address on Ethereum. Anyone can submit public-knowledge `Bridge` transactions
but they will not get reimbursed for doing so. To not mix the concept of
reimbursement with the logic of the `Bridge` contract, we placed the
reimbursement logic in a special contract called `MaintainerProxy`. Only
DAO-authorized maintainers can call `Bridge` via `MaintainerProxy` and get
reimbursed for the call but it does not block anyone from calling `Bridge`
directly. The only difference is that those calling `Bridge` directly will not
get reimbursed. This should be enough to prevent malicious actors from
front-running honest maintainers. Maintainers are getting authorized by a DAO
with a call to `MaintainerProxy.authorize` and can be deauthorized by a DAO with
a call to `MaintainerProxy.unauthorize`.

`Bridge.submitDepositSweepProof` and `Bridge.submitRedemptionProof` are
functions that must be called often and they execute quite an expensive SPV
proof. These functions need to be protected with `onlyMaintainer` notifier in
`MaintainerProxy`.

`Bridge.submitMovingFundsProof` and `Bridge.submitMovedFundsSweepProof` are
functions that are called less often but they also execute an expensive SPV
proof. The input parameters to them are pretty much the same as for
`Bridge.submitDepositSweepProof` and `Bridge.submitRedemptionProof` so we assume
calling them is also the maintainer's responsibility and we protect them in
`MaintainerProxy` with `onlyMaintainer` modifier.

It is important to note that the off-chain client software should not rely
entirely on maintainers to call these functions. If proofs are not submitted on
time, the wallet can be accused of fraud, or it can get slashed because of
exceeding redemption timeout, moving funds timeout, or sweeping moved funds
timeout. The wallet should expect the maintainer bots to do their work but it
should also monitor if that actually happens. If not, the wallet should submit
the proof itself - directly to the `Bridge` - to avoid slashing. Such a call
would not be reimbursed but it should also never be needed.

Functions like `Bridge.requestNewWallet`, `Bridge.notifyMovingFundsBelowDust`,
`Bridge.notifyWalletCloseable`, or `Bridge.notifyWalletClosingPeriodElapsed`
are typical cleanup, maintenance functions. A wallet does not lose anything if
these functions are not called on time so the responsibility of calling them can
be left entirely to maintainers. This is why these functions are protected with
`onlyMaintainer` modifier in the `MaintainerProxy` contract.

The last category of functions are functions that can be called only by the
wallet or that are only in the wallet's interest to be called.
`Bridge.submitMovingFundsCommitment` can be called only by the wallet.
`Bridge.resetMovingFundsTimeout` can be called by anyone but is highly
associated with `Bridge.submitMovingFundsCommitment`.
`Bridge.defeatFraudChallenge` and `Bridge.defeatFraudChallengeWithHeartbeat` can
be called by anyone but they are in the best interest of the wallet to be called
(otherwise, the wallet can get slashed) and they should be called rarely, if
ever. Since there is practically no problem with front-running for the functions
from this category, they do not need to be protected with `onlyMaintainer`
modifier in `MaintainerProxy`. We could even place them outside of the
`MaintainerProxy` but to avoid introducing an additional `WalletProxy` contract
or mixing reimbursement code with `Bridge` contract, they are placed in
`MaintainerProxy` contract even though they are expected to be called by the
wallet.
