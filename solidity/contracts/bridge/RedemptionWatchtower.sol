///         in the event of malicious redemption requests such as those sourced

///         Guardians that can object to a redemption request. If a redemption
///         is objected to by a redemption guardian, it is delayed. Two
///         subsequent objections from redemption guardians results in a veto
///         of the redemption request. A veto returns redeemed amount to the
///         requester while inflicting a freeze and financial penalty on the
///         amount. The goal of this penalty is to introduce a cost that guards
///         against repeated malicious redemption requests.
