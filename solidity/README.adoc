== Build, test and deploy

tMEWC contracts use https://hardhat.org/[*Hardhat*] development environment.
To build and deploy these contracts, please follow the instructions presented
below.

=== Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- https://nodejs.org[Node.js] >14.17.4
- https://yarnpkg.com[Yarn] >1.22.10

=== Build contracts

To build the smart contracts, install node packages first:
```
yarn install
```
Once packages are installed, you can build the smart contracts using:
```
yarn build
```
Compiled contracts will land in the `build` directory.

*NOTE:* The `tmewc` package contains an indirect dependency to
`@summa-tx/relay-sol@2.0.2` package, which downloads one of its sub-dependencies
via unathenticated `git://` protocol. That protocol is no longer supported by
GitHub. This means that in certain situations installation of the package or
update of its dependencies using Yarn may result in `The unauthenticated git
protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported` error. +
As a workaround, we advise changing Git configuration to use `https://` protocol
instead of `git://` by executing:
```
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

=== Test contracts

There are multiple test scenarios living in the `test` directory.

You can run unit tests with:
```
yarn test
```

The tests marked as "pending" during `yarn test` are integration tests.

You can run integration tests with:

```
yarn test:integration
```

System tests are implemented separately, in the
link:../system-tests/[`system-tests`] directory of the `tmewc` repository.

=== Deploy contracts

To deploy all contracts on the given network, please run:
```
yarn deploy --network <network>
```

If contracts haven't been built yet or changes occurred, this task will build
the contracts before running the deployment script. This command produces
an `export.json` file containing contract deployment info.
